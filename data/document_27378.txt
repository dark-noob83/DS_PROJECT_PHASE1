A late payment can stay on your credit report for up to seven years. This is the standard time limit for most items. Only a bankruptcy can stay longer -- up to 10 years in some cases. But for late payments, seven is the magic number. You can think of your credit reports as a record of your previous debt payments. In your case, the creditor is Macy's. Once it has been reported, a late payment can stay on your credit reports for up to seven years. After that they must be removed in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. Derogatory entries can do a lot of damage to your FICO credit score.
Late payments are black marks that normally stay on a credit report for 7 years. That's true of most negative information like foreclosures, Chapter 13 bankruptcies, charge-offs and paid tax liens; a Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays around for 10 years and unpaid tax liens can linger indefinitely. Creditors usually report late payments to credit bureaus when you run 30 days or more past due. Late payments seriously damage your credit score and make it difficult to get credit, as well as saddle you with high interest rates.
Counting Seven Years When it comes to your credit report, negative information typically stays on your report for seven years. This means that late credit card payments stay on your credit report for seven years from the date the payment was missed.

Considerations. A 30-day late payment will remain on your credit record for seven years, but the negative impact it has on your credit rating will decrease over time. The most recent information on your credit report has the greatest impact on your scores. A 30-day late payment notation is a negative item for your credit. Like most negative items, the 30-day late payment will only remain on your credit report for seven years. After seven years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act dictates that the credit bureaus must delete it from your record
