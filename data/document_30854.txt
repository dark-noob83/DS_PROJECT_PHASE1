A stationary point may be a minimum, maximum, or inflection point. SEE ALSO: Critical Point, Derivative, Extremum, First Derivative Test, Inflection Point, Maximum, Minimum, Second Derivative Test CITE THIS AS: Weisstein, Eric W. Stationary Point.. From MathWorld --A Wolfram Web Resource.
The stationary points are easy to visualize on the graph of a function of one variable: they correspond to the points on the graph where the tangent is horizontal (more specifically, parallel to the x-axis). If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example the function has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.
The blue squares are inflection points. In mathematics, particularly in calculus, a stationary point or critical point of a differentiable function of one variable is a point of the domain of the function where the derivative is zero (equivalently, the slope of the graph at that point is zero). If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example the function has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.
Stationary point definition. up vote 1 down vote favorite. I know the definition of stationary point for a differential and continuous function $f$ is the follow: Definition 1: Let $S=S_1\times...\times S_p$ a no empty set. It is: Definition 2: $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$ is a stationary point for $f: Sâ†’\mathbb{R}$ if. $$x_i=\arg\min_{y_i\in\mathcal{S_i}}f(x_1,...,x_{i-1},y_i,x_{i+1},...,x_p)$$. for all $i=1,...,p.$.
Here's an example. Find the stationary values of the function f defined by f(x) = x 3 - 6x 2 + 9x + 1 and determine their nature. f'(x) = 3x 2 - 12x + 9. = 3(x 2 - 4x + 3). = 3(x - 1)(x - 3). for stationary points. Put this information into a nature table and you get the following.
A stationary or turning points on a graph, is the point where the gradient is equal to zero. It is often useful to fi... 
The point at the peak is a stationary point. A point or points in the graph of a function that tells that the function itself is not decreasing nor increasing is called a stationary point. Not all functions have stationary points. An inclined line for example is a function which has no stationary point or points. A curve of a mountain viewed in two dimension has can have its stationary point at the peak (of course, because at the peak, the mountain stops increasing nor decreasing). 
Not to be confused with a fixed point where x = f (x) . This article is about stationary points or critical points of a real-valued function of one real variable. For the general notion, see Critical point (mathematics) . If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example the function has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.
