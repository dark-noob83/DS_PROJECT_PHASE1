Properties of Ferromagnetic materials a) A ferromagnetic material is strongly attracted by a magnet. b) When a rod of ferromagnetic substance is suspended in magnetic field, it quickly aligns itself along the direction of the magnetic field.
Diamagnetic, Paramagnetic, and Ferromagnetic Materials. When a material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic forces of the material's electrons will be affected. This effect is known as Faraday's Law of Magnetic Induction.
Table of magnetic properties. When ferromagnetic materials are used in applications like an iron-core solenoid, the relative permeability gives you an idea of the kind of multiplication of the applied magnetic field that can be achieved by having the ferromagnetic core present.
Answer   Some ferromagnetic elements are: Iron Nickel Cobalt Gadolinium Dyprosium   Ferromagnetic means-a substance such as iron in which the magnetic momen … ts of the atoms spontaneously line up with each other, making a large net magnetic moment.
The element Nickel (Ni) is one of the few ferromagnetic metals. Ferromagnetic means they are attracted to magnets and can be magnetized themselves. Most metals aren’t magnetic with the exception of iron, nickel, cobalt, gadolinium, neodymium and samarium. Because Nickel (Ni) is ferromagnetic it is used in making Alnico magnets (consisting of aluminium, nickel, and cobalt).
A magnet made of alnico, an iron alloy, with its keeper. Ferromagnetism is the theory which explains how materials become magnets. Ferromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets, or are attracted to magnets. In physics, several different types of magnetism are distinguished.
