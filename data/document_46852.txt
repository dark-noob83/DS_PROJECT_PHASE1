According to Business Wire, in 2003: Ten percent of Americans spend on average $300 per year to tan indoors.

Enhancements in technology and consumer acceptance are fueling the industry's growth. A suntan is the result of injury to the epidermis, the top layer of your skin. I think that this is a serious underestimate of how much people spend tanning, but I suppose it's a ballpark figure that we can work with. I know women that tan year-round, and they aren't paying $30, they're paying well over $100 every couple of weeks.
