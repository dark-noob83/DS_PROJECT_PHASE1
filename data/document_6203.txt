From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A mucous membrane or mucosa (plural, mucosae or mucosas; Latin tunica mucosa) is a lining of mostly endodermal origin. It consists of an epithelium (a layer, or layers of epithelial cells) and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue. Some mucous membranes are involved with digestion in the absorption of insoluble food molecules and secretion (releasing chemicals from glands). The thick fluid secreted by some mucous membranes and/or associated glands is termed mucus.
10 most extreme places on Earth. A mucous membrane is a layer of epithelial tissue which lines an area of the body which comes into contact with air. Mucous membranes are moist because of the presence of glands which secrete a thick fluid known as mucus, and they are important for a number of bodily functions.

muÂ·cous membrane. Any of the membranes lining the passages of the body that open onto the outside, such as the respiratory and digestive tracts. Cells in the mucous membranes secrete mucus, which lubricates the membranes and protects against infection. mucous membrane. n. 1. (Anatomy) a mucus-secreting membrane that lines body cavities or passages that are open to the external environment. Also called: mucosa.
The nose and the sinuses are lined with a membrane that produces mucus. 1  When air enters the nose, it is warmed, moistened, and filtered before passing into the lungs. 2  Dust, smoke, bacteria, and other irritants often become trapped in the mucus that lines the nasal passages. If the mucous membrane becomes inflamed, it may swell, blocking the openings that drain the sinuses. Mucus inside the sinuses then becomes trapped. Both the inflammation and the pressure of trapped mucus cause pain.
They are found in your nose and in your mouth also around your eyes. Mucous membranes are tissues that line body cavities or canals such as the throat, nose, mouth, urethra, rectum, and vagina. Mucous membranes produce a thick, slippery liquid called mucus that protects the membranes and keeps them moist. Mucus membranes line the nose and throat.Some creams ,such as Sudocream carry a warning not to get any on the mucus membranes,they mean the nose and mouth/throat.
