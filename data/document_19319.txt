Traditional halloumi is made from unpasteurised sheep and goat milk. Many people also like halloumi that has been aged; kept in its own brine, it is much drier, much stronger and much saltier. This cheese is very different from the milder halloumi that Western chefs use as an ingredient. Cypriots like eating halloumi with watermelon in the warm months, and as halloumi and lountza – a combination of halloumi cheese and either a slice of smoked pork, or a soft lamb sausage.
Techniques of Production. The key ingredient in making halloumi is fresh milk which, according to the Standard, CY 594/1985 is either sheep or goat or a mixture of these with or without cow s milk. The remainder materials are rennet (excluding rennet coming out from the stomach of pigs), salt and mint, fresh or dried. 
Soft, mould-ripened cheeses, such as brie, camembert and chevre (a type of goat's cheese) are not safe to eat in pregnancy. Soft, blue-veined cheeses, such as danish blue and roquefort, are also not considered safe to eat in pregnancy. There is only a very small amount of listeria bacteria in hard cheeses, so they are not considered a risk during pregnancy.

Halloumi. Halloumi is a Cypriot firm, brined, slightly springy white cheese, traditionally made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, although these days cow’s milk is also used. Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve. Since the cheese has a high melting point, it can be easily fried or grilled. Its unusualness lies in the preparation of the cheese where no acid or acid-producing bacterium is required. Halloumi is generally served during the warmer months with watermelon, due to its refreshing qualities.

Halloumi Cheese. The cooking of the final cheese in hot whey is integral to the making of Halloumi, so we will begin by filtering off the whey from the curds until you can see the curds below. I do this using a sanitized colander and just scooping the whey out with another ladle, bowl, or cup. 1 Re-hydrate in 1/4 cup water before heating milk and then add when milk is at the proper temperature. 2  Calcium chloride for pasteurized cold stored milk - 3/8 tsp per gallon. 3  Usually none needed if using fresh raw milk. 4  Liquid rennet (1/8 tsp for raw milk up to 1/4 tsp for pasteurized).

Cheese is great source of calcium, and many varieties are safe to eat in pregnancy.
