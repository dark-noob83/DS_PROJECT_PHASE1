The Hb level is expressed as the amount of Hb in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, where 1 deciliter is 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, sex of the person, and other factors like the start of adolescence. 
The normal range of hemoglobin (also haemoglobin)  varies in men, women, and children.    The normal range of hemoglobin in male is 13.5 to 18gm/dl (gram per  decilit … er).    For female it is 12 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter).    In a children 11 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter).    And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the  normal range of hemoglobin.    If the hemoglobin is below normal, this is called anemia. But  nothing to worry.
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. The normal adult hemoglobin (Hbg) molecule contains two alpha-globulin chains and two beta-globulin chains. In fetuses and infants, beta chains are not common and the hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two gamma chain

And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the normal range of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin levels are often measured in grammes per decilitre (g/dl). In a children 11 to 16gm/dl (gram per deciliter).    And for a pregnant woman 11 to 12g/dl (gram per deciliter) is the  normal range of hemoglobin.

The normal hemoglobin range is generally defined as 13.5 to 17.5 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood for men and 12.0 to 15.5 g/dL for women. The normal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. Blood tests show whether levels of different substances in your blood fall within a normal range. ...

Normal hemoglobin levels are different in women and in men. In non-pregnant women, normal hemoglobin ranges from 120 g/L to 160 g/L. In men, normal hemoglobin levels range from 140 g/L to 180 g/L. Canadian Blood Services tests each donor’s hemoglobin at the clinic and requires a minimum of 125 g/L for donation. 
The normal range for hemoglobin is: 1  For men, 13.5 to 17.5 grams per deciliter. 2  For women, 12.0 to 15.5 grams per deciliter. 
For people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin A1c test is between 4% and 5.6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes.
