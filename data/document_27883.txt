Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) occurs when a person’s superior vena cava is partially blocked or compressed. The superior vena cava is a major vein in a person’s body. It carries blood from the head, neck, upper chest, and arms to the heart. Cancer is usually the main cause of SVCS. Relieving side effects, called symptom management or palliative care, is an important part of cancer care and treatment.
