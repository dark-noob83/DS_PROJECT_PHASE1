5. Cook the roast for 3 to 4 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Use a meat thermometer to determine the roast is done cooking. The internal temperature should reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). 
If a pan with a rack is not available, place the meat on sturdy foods such as potatoes or carrots to keep it from getting too wet. 5. Turn the oven down to 200ºF and cook for about 1 hour per pound.

3. Cooking Temperature. There are varying opinions about what the perfect temperature to cook a roast beef but in my experience starting the beef in a very hot oven 425F/220C/Gas 7 for the first 30 mins then lower the temperature to 375F/190C/Gas5 for the remaining cooking time then .... 
How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast. Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. Cooking at a constant oven temperature of 300°F (160°C), a 5- to 8-lb standing rib roast will take 17-19 minutes per pound for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 minutes for medium, and 27-30 minutes for well done.
First, put the roast in a 450F preheated oven. Cook it, uncovered for 15 minutes at 450F. Then, without opening the oven door, turn the heat down to 325F. Now, cook the roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 135F. Letting the roast rest for 10-15 minutes, pulls the juices back into the roast and results in juicy tender meat. Use a nice long craving knife to slice up the roast. There are many different cuts of beef and the top sirloin roast is one of my favourites.
