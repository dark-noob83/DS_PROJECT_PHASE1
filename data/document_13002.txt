1 Dual/Siamese: Dual and/or Siamese coaxial cable have two cables bound together at the jacket. 2  This type of cable can come in different variations. 3  One variation is two RG6 type cables bound together by the jacket. 4  It is commonly referred to as dual RG6 and is typically used for satellite TV installations. Today RG6 is the more commonly used RG-type. RG6 is used in a variety of applications, both residential and commercial. RG6 is typically a double shielded coaxial cable about 6.86mm in diameter with a center conductor a bit larger than that of the RG59 type.
1 Male connectors have the center wire sticking out, while female connectors have a space for the center wire to stick into. 2  Be sure to use the opposite gender to the connector you will be making. 3  Most cables end in male connectors. 4  Use an SMA (sub-miniature Version A) connector for very small coaxial cable. 1 Be sure to use the opposite gender to the connector you will be making. 2  Most cables end in male connectors. 3
The most common type of connector used with coaxial cables is the Bayone-Neill-Concelman (BNC) connector (See fig. 4). Different types of adapters are available for BNC connectors, including a T-connector, barrel connector, and terminator. Connectors on the cable are the weakest points in any network. To help avoid problems with your network, always use the BNC connectors that crimp, rather screw, onto the cable. Fig.
Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced /ˈkoʊ.aeks/), æks is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating, layer surrounded by a tubular conducting. Shield many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or. jacket Many conventional coaxial cables use braided copper wire forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, but it also means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat.

Coaxial cables can also be used with a variety of hardware and adapters. Some of the more common pieces of equipment used in conjunction with some of the more common coaxial designs are passive devices such as splitters, F-pin couplers (Barrels), Diplexers, etc. Coaxial cable is like the Swiss Army knife of cables. Today RG6 is the more commonly used RG-type. RG6 is used in a variety of applications, both residential and commercial. RG6 is typically a double shielded coaxial cable about 6.86mm in diameter with a center conductor a bit larger than that of the RG59 type.
The ends of coaxial cables usually terminate with connectors. Coaxial connectors are designed to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable. Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Many conventional coaxial cables use braided copper wire forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, but it also means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat.
The outer channel serves as a ground. Many of these cables or pairs of coaxial tubes can be placed in a single outer sheathing and, with repeaters, can carry information for a great distance. Coaxial cable is sometimes used by telephone companies from their central office to the telephone poles near users. Coaxial cables are used by telcos to carry signals from a central office to telephone poles and by cable TV providers for service in communities. Twisted pair copper wire and optical fiber may be used instead of coaxial cable. Coax cables have concentric layers of electrical conductors and insulating material.
This cable type is often used to replace the older RG59 wiring, which has a lower bandwidth. Coaxial cable is also often used in home theater setups with digital coaxial cables, which are used to transfer digital surround sound audio from a source to your receiver/amplifier. We also carry BNC cables, typically used to carry video from a security or remote camera to a DVR
