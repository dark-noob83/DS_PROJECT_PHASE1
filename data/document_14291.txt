Review. There's still monstrous fun to be had in Don't Push The Button! . . . interactive, silly, and just plain good fun. The simple but colorful illustrations are absolutely fitting for the idea of the book and the age of the readers.  - Parenthood.com.
This is a single button communication device with 20 seconds of memory. Teachers, parents, siblings, and friends can record important messages for nonverbal students to share in social settings. The button has a large 5-inch activation surface and is brightly colored, making it an easy target.
In 2008, de Botton helped start the School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today's uptight culture. His goal is (through any of his mediums) to help clients learn how to live wisely and well..
Why you should listen. It started in 1997, when Alain de Botton turned away from writing novels and instead wrote a touching extended essay titled How Proust Can Change Your Life, which became an unlikely blockbuster in the self-helpcategory.
I expected this to be like the Grover The Monster At The End of This Book book. You know, don't push the button, don't push the button, don't push the button, and then some socko finish. I was pleasantly surprised by how the book bobs and weaves and is a lot more active and entertaining that just that. MILD SPOILER, so don't tell your four year old.
