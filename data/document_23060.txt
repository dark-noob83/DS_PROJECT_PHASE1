Table Height. The height of a standard table is between 28 inches and 30 inches and a counter-height table is usually between 34 and 36 inches high. Some counter-height tables, known as bar tables, are even taller at between 40 and 42
These tables are typically around 40-42 in height. Therefore, the bar stools are in the 28-30 range. Bar height furniture is most commonly used with home bars but can also be found in some pub sets and counter set-ups. These tables often be mistaken for Counter Height Tables and vice-a-versa.
Furniture specialists suggest that you ensure at least 15 inches of clearance for people's knees below the counter-height tables and 12 inches for the bar-height tables. For each kind of table, have at least 24 inches of space between each seat so your guests don't bump elbows.
