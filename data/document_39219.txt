In the last five to six decades, professionals and scientists using the metric system of units defined the standard reference conditions of temperature and pressure for expressing gas volumes as being 15 °C (288.15 K; 59.00 °F) and 101.325 kPa (1.00 atm; 760 Torr). An unofficial, but commonly used standard is standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) as a temperature of 298.15 K (25 °C, 77 °F) and an absolute pressure of exactly 1 atm (101,325 Pa).
Answer: STP in chemistry is the abbreviation for Standard Temperature and Pressure. STP most commonly is used when performing calculations on gases, such as gas density. The standard temperature is 273 K (0° Celsius) and the standard pressure is 1 atm pressure. At STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 L of volume (molar volume). STP commonly is used when standard state conditions are applied to calculations. Standard state conditions, which include standard temperature and pressure, may be recognized in calculations by the superscript circle.
NIST uses a temperature of 20 °C (293.15 K, 68 °F) and an absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi, 1 atm). The International Standard Metric Conditions for natural gas and similar fluids are 288.15 K (15.00 °C; 59.00 °F) and 101.325 kPa. An unofficial, but commonly used standard is standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) as a temperature of 298.15 K (25 °C, 77 °F) and an absolute pressure of exactly 1 atm (101,325 Pa).
The molar volume at stp If you have done simple calculations from equations, you have probably used the molar volume of a gas. 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 dm3 at stp (standard temperature and pressure, taken as 0°C and 1 atmosphere pressure). You may also have used a value of 24.0 dm3 at room temperature and pressure (taken as about 20°C and 1 atmosphere). The molar volume of an ideal gas is therefore 22.4 dm3 at stp. And, of course, you could redo this calculation to find the volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at room temperature and pressure-or any other temperature and pressure.
One mole of any gas at STP will have a volume of 22.4 L. Volumes of gases change with changes of temperature and pressure. Therefore standard temperature and pressure (abbreviated STP) have been chosen of comparing volumes of gases. Standard temperature is 0 o C and standard pressure is 1 atm or 760mm.
Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) is defined as 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere of pressure. Gas density and volumes are compared at a Standard Temperature and Pressure of 273.15 Kelvin and 760 torr. At STP, one mole of any gas should have a volume of 22.4 liters. Related Calculator: 
If we wished to calculate this volume at another, non-standard state temperature, such as 100 °C, we would simply substitute 373 K for the temperature (100 °C = 373 K) in the above calculation. The Ideal Gas Law is a very handy equation for estimating gas properties at both standard and non-standard conditions. 
The standard temperature is the freezing point of water and the standard pressure is one standard atmosphere. These can be quantified as follows: Standard temperature: 0°C = 273.15 K Standard pressure = 1 atmosphere = 760 mmHg = 101.3 kPa Standard volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at STP: 22.4 liters. Standard pressure = 1 atmosphere = 760 mmHg = 101.3 kPa. Standard volume of 1 mole of an ideal gas at STP: 22.4 liters. In such a gas, all the internal energy is in the form of kinetic energy and any change in internal energy is accompanied by a change in temperature. An ideal gas can be characterized by three state variables: absolute pressure (P), volume (V), and absolute temperature (T).

Avogadro discovered that under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, (1atm and 273K) a sample of gas occupies a volume of 22.4 L. It was discovered that the number of atoms present in 12g of carbon is 6.023 x 10 2 3 atoms. This is referred to as Avogadro number. Volumes of gases change with changes of temperature and pressure. Therefore standard temperature and pressure (abbreviated STP) have been chosen of comparing volumes of gases. Standard temperature is 0 o C and standard pressure is 1 atm or 760mm.
