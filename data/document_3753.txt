A resort fee is usually an involuntary nightly surcharge imposed by hotels, nominally to cover the cost of certain amenities.
Some hotels charge a resort fee, an extra per-day charge added to your regular room rate that is payable upon check-in or check-out. Resorts may or may not disclose this fee ahead of time, and it can add hundreds to the cost of your vacation.
The amount of a resort fee is the same if you book directly with the hotel, or through an online travel site. Below is a list of hotel resort fees and what it includes. In addition, there is a 12 percent tax on the fees.

A resort fee is a (usually unadvertised) mandatory fee tacked onto a nightly room rate. Fees can be as low as $3.50 per night at the Clarion Inn & Suites at International Drive, Orlando (they call this one a safe fee), to as much as $60 per night for the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort, Puerto Rico.
By charging a resort fee, the hotel is able to advertise an arbitrarily lower nightly rate, which may give an advantage over competitors not charging the fee who must then advertise a higher nightly rate in order to realise the same income.
The fees are also explained by the resorts as a way to cover the cost of free self-parking, lounge entertainment, energy, pool access and pool towels. Below is a comprehensive list of the hotels in Las Vegas that charge resort fees.
