On average, concrete slabs can cost anywhere from $75 to $110 per square metre. That's still quite a spread, but it gives you a starting point for comparing quotes. If your slab is going on a flat block of land with easy access, expect the price to be on the lower end of the scale.
The average cost of a concrete slab will be between $5 and $7 dollars per square foot or $135 and $189 per cubic yard.
The cost of concrete slabs also needs to include the cost of excavation. A base of gravel that is normally four inches thick is laid after the area is dug and footings are put in place. The cost of gravel is generally $0.79 per square foot.
Needless to say, installing and/or making concrete is a job better left to the pros, but if you are up for a DIY challenge, you will certainly save some dough. According to our concrete slab material estimator, the average minimum cost per square foot of a concrete slab is $1.36 and the maximum is $1.88. By comparison, the price per square foot for a cement slab is $5.50.
Figure in the cost of excavation. A concrete slab is generally installed over a gravel base. The base is 4 inches, and the slab itself is 4 inches, with 2 inches above ground and 2 inches below. This means that for the average slab, you will be digging down 6 inches.
I'll base my price on what my actual estimate would be to install a 6 thick concrete slab for one of my customers. Base cost for a 6 thick concrete slab -- $4.00 dollars per square foot --. Take the length of the concrete slab x the width of the slab to get the. total square footage. Multiply the total square footage by 4 (dollars) to get the total price. L x W x $4.00 in this example.
