The DVCPRO Video Format. DVCPRO is a format developed by Panasonic. It is a variation of the DV format, aimed at the professional market (in particular for ENG work). DVCPRO is also known as DVCPRO Standard or DVCPRO25, to differentiate it from other variations. DVCPRO cassettes have a yellow lid, DVCPRO50 have a blue lid and DVCPRO HD have a red lid. DVCPRO VCRs can play both DV and DVCAM tapes but cannot record in these formats. MiniDV tapes can be played with an adaptor.
DVCPRO HD is a high definition addition to the DV/DVCPRO format family, making it simple to adapt your existing DV-and FireWire-based editing workflow to HD video.
DV is a format for storing digital video. It was launched in 1995 with joint efforts of leading producers of video camera recorders. The original DV specification, known as Blue Book, was standardized within the IEC 61834 family of standards.
The DVCPRO HD Format. DVCPRO HD is an enhanced version of DVCPRO and DVCPRO50. DVCPRO HD increases the data rate to 100MBps, which is why it is sometimes called DVCPRO100. DVCPRO HD cassettes are identified by a red lid. Despite the HD tag, DVCPRO HD is not true high-definition in the current sense.
