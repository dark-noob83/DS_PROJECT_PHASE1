These symptoms include nausea, retching and/or vomiting. Some women only have nausea in the morning, and others have nausea all day and night. Morning sickness typically begins between 4 to 9 weeks of pregnancy and is usually the most severe between 7 to 12 weeks. For most women, morning sickness usually eases between 12 to 16 weeks. Women with severe nausea with or without vomiting or HG (see page 2) in a previous pregnancy have a 75 to 85% chance of having severe morning sickness in a future pregnancy. So having the experience does not seem to make the bouts of nausea, vomiting and/or dry heaves any better.
Morning sickness usually starts in early pregnancy and peaks at about nine weeks of pregnancy (Niebyl et al 2010) . It usually improves toward the end of the first trimester, and clears up completely for many women by 16 weeks to 20 weeks of pregnancy (NHS Choices 2015, NICE 2013, Niebyl et al 2010) . 
About half of pregnant women suffer from both nausea and vomiting, one quarter have nausea alone, and one quarter luck out altogether. The nausea usually starts around 6 weeks of pregnancy, but it can begin as early as 4 weeks. (In fact, the technical medical term is nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.) For some pregnant women, the symptoms are worse in the morning and ease up over the course of the day, but they can strike at any time and, for most women, last all day long.

Sperm last up to 3 days in the uterus. Good Luck :-).

Morning sickness usually starts around week six of your pregnancy. But because every pregnancy is different, this can vary from woman to woman. If you have morning sickness, you may feel queasy when you wake up. But although it is called morning sickness, nausea can strike at any time of the day or night. If your morning sickness is severe, you may feel very sick and be vomiting often. The most severe form of morning sickness is hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which means excessive vomiting during pregnancy. If you cannot eat or drink without being sick, and are vomiting several times a day, you may have HG.
Pregnancy No comments. Generally speaking, morning sickness does not last any longer than the first trimester of pregnancy. For the most part, morning sickness will start somewhere around the sixth week of pregnancy, and should end around the 12th week of pregnancy. Still, it is not entirely unheard of for morning sickness to start earlier; some women claim that they have experienced morning sickness as early as the second week of pregnancy. And, on the other end of things, morning sickness can indeed last long into the second trimester, although this is much more rare.
