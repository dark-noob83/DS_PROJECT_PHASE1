The normal values of lymphocytes are 20 to 40 percent of total leukocyte count (relative value) or 10,000-4,000/mm3. Clinical Implications. Lymphocytosis (a potentially abnormal increase in the amount of circulating lymphocytes) is measured with the following values:
The normal range of lymphocytes in the blood is usually between 1200 and 3200 lymphocytes per milliliter of blood. Please note that different medical laboratories have different evaluation standards for finding the normal lymphocyte count.
1 A low lymphocytes count is also as dangerous a condition as a high lymphocytes count. 2  When the percentage of lymphocytes that form the total number of white blood cells in the human body is lower than fifteen percent, then it signifies low levels of lymphocytes in the body.
The lymphocytes form about 15 percent to 40 percent of the total number of white blood cells present in the body. A decrease or increase in the normal levels of lymphocytes is considered as abnormal and usually an indication of the presence of some infections or health conditions.
Normal lymphocyte count in blood. 1  The normal levels of lymphocytes present in the blood usually range between 1200 and 3200 lymphocytes per milliliter of blood. 2  However, it may be noted that different laboratories may follow different standards of valuing the normal levels of lymphocytes.
1 The normal levels of lymphocytes present in the blood usually range between 1200 and 3200 lymphocytes per milliliter of blood. 2  However, it may be noted that different laboratories may follow different standards of valuing the normal levels of lymphocytes.
The value is usually represented by a percent of WBC (white blood cells) and the range varies according to measurement method, laboratory and other. Some labs accept as normal â€¦ values 22-50%, other 16-45%.
Lymphocytes comprise 15 to 40 percent of the total number of white blood cells in the human body. A decrease or increase in the normal range of lymphocytes can indicate infections or health conditions.
