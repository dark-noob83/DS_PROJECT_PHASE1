There are rules about how long it should take for a cheque to clear. These rules apply to cheques paid into current, basic and savings accounts. In a current or basic account, it should take a maximum of two days after paying in a cheque, before you should start earning interest on the money paid in. You should be able to withdraw the money within four days (six days from a savings account) and after six days, you can be sure that the cheque won't bounce.
