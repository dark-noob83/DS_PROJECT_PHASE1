Your salary does not count as profit; it's one of the costs of doing business. Profit is the reward you get for taking the risks of being in business for yourself. It also provides money to expand and develop your business. Profit is usually expressed as a percentage of total costs. To determine how much your labor is worth, pick a figure for your annual salary. This can be what you earned for doing similar work when you were an employee, what other employees earn for similar work, or how much you'd like to earn (as long as your goal is reasonable).
Step 5. Add the labor costs for each employee pay scale to find total labor costs. In the example, $1,260 plus $2,000 plus $962 equals total labor costs of $4,222 for Firm A's five employees for the week. Add together the total number of hours worked by pay scales for hourly employees. In the example, the $14 an hour workers a total 90 hours this week. The $20 an hour employees worked 100 hours this week. Related Reading: How to Calculate Unit Manufacturing Costs Using Direct Labor Hours.
1 To achieve a 30% gross margin, this labor cost needs to be marked up approximately 43%. 2  Industry average price = $6006 ($4200 x 1.43) – so this is the labor rate (price) included in the quote to the customer. 1 Industry average cost for this job = $4200 (120 x $35). 2  To achieve a 30% gross margin, this labor cost needs to be marked up approximately 43%. 3  Industry average price = $6006 ($4200 x 1.43) – so this is the labor rate (price) included in the quote to the customer. 4  That would leave you with the following:

It is the amount a business charges above their direct cost. If your contractor has a 1.50 markup (which is reasonable for a remodeling contractor), that means that if the estimated cost for a job is $10,000, they'll multiply the $10,000 x 1.50 and arrive at a $15,000 sales price.

Independent contractors (ICs) can charge for their services in a variety of ways, such as a fixed amount for an entire project, an hourly fee, or a sales commission. No matter how you bill clients, however, you first need to figure out how much to charge -- even if you charge a fixed fee for the whole project. To determine how much your labor is worth, pick a figure for your annual salary. This can be what you earned for doing similar work when you were an employee, what other employees earn for similar work, or how much you'd like to earn (as long as your goal is reasonable).
Example: You have an employee you are paying $20 an hour. You charge them out at $20 x 2.6, or $52 an hour. Or, take the same employee at $20 an hour and add the labor burden at 1.35 (or whatever your labor burden is-in some areas, like California, the rate is closer to 1.48). That makes their total cost $27/hour. That is the number that goes on your estimate sheet
