Female Reproductive Organ The female parts of a flower consist of an ovary, which contains one or more ovules, a style and the stigma. The ovary is at the base of the flower.From the ovary, extends a tubular structure called the style and on the top of the style is a surface receptive to pollen calle
A flower's structure consists of four whorls of leafy material, including the calyx, corolla, gynoecium, and androecium. In each of these whorls are one of four organs, including petals, sepals, stamens, and pistils. Petals and sepals do not play an active role in the reproductive process. Stamens and pistils, the flower's male and female reproductive organs, do aid in reproduction. In addition to these parts, a flower also has an ovary located at the base of the pistil. The ovary is composed of leafy structures called carpels.
There are about 250,000 known species. A flower is basically made up of four concentric rings of structures. There is an outer ring of modified leaves called sepals. These provide protection to the flower before it opens and are usually green. This outer ring is known as the calyx.
A flower is usually made up of _____ parts which are arranged in ______ inside each other. The sepal is the outermost ring. It _____ the flower when it was in bud. The petals of a plant are often ________ __________ to attract _______.
Flowers arise from a modified stem called the receptacle. Four types of modified leaves, are arranged in whorls or spirals from the receptacle. The first group called the calyx is made of sepals. Sepals are usually green and rather tough to protect the more delicate parts of the flower bud.
Pistils-the female reproductive organs usually occur in the very center of the flower and are often surrounded by the stamens, petals, and sepals. Flowers may have just one simple pistil [as in Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea)], or two, three, four, five, or more separate pistils as in Consolida spp. (larkspur).
