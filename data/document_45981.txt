Definition: The doctrine that memory is encoded and stored with specific cues related to the context in which it was formed. The more closely the retrieval cues match the form in which information was encoded, the better it will be remembered. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_specificity_principle.
Encoding Specificity is a principle that states that human memories are more easily retrieved if external conditions (emotional cues) at the time of retrieval are similar to those in existence at the time the memory was stored.
Encoding Specificity. The encoding specificity principle of memory (Tulving & Thomson, 1973) provides an general theoretical framework for understanding how contextual information affects memory. Specifically, the principle states that memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval.

The encoding specificity principle provides a framework for understanding how contextual information affects memory and recall. The principle, proposed by researchers Thomson and Tulving, states that memory is most effective when information available at encoding is also present at retrieval.
A definition of the term encoding variability principle is presented. The principle was formulated by the American psychologist Gordon Howard Bower. Encoding variability refers to the degree of variability in the environment and mood in which one learns the same material.
