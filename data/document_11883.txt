From SNPedia. As most commonly used within SNPedia, genotype refers to the pair of SNPs inherited at a given chromosomal position, one inherited from Dad, one inherited from Mom. Example: rs1234(A;C) is how we indicate someone with a (A;C) genotype at snp rs1234.
5 This SNP has 3 possible genotypes: CC, CT, and TT. The CC genotype is associated with better rapid virological response (RVR) and SVR rates than are the CT or TT genotypes. 3-5 A favorable IL28B genotype improves the treatment response considerably in individuals infected with unfavorable HCV genotypes (1 or 4).
It does not detect other alleles of this SNP or alleles of other SNPs. Although unlikely, there is a possibility that gene rearrangements may interfere with genotyping. Additional assistance in interpretation of results is available from our Genetic Counselors by calling 1-866-GENE-INFO (1-866-436-3463).

SNPs are one of the most common types of genetic variation. An SNP is a single base pair mutation at a specific locus, usually consisting of two alleles (where the rare allele frequency etiology of many human diseases and are becoming of particular interest in pharmacogenetics.

SNP genotyping is the measurement of genetic variations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between members of a species. It is a form of genotyping, which is the measurement of more general genetic variation.
