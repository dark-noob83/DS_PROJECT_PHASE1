Introduction The Zagros Mountains are located in western and southwestern Iran at the eastern edge of the Persian Gulf and are a part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain chain that stretches across much of Southwest Asia and the Middle East (Figure 1). 2. Sanadaj-Sirjan Zone The Sanadaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) contains the metamorphic core of the Zagros continental collision zone in Western Iran (Figure 6). This zone lies to the northeast of the Crush Zone in a parallel orientation to the rest of the Zagros Mountains.
Zagros Mountains have quite a sedimentary origin and are primarily made of limestone. High Zagros Zagros or above, the Paleozoic rocks are mainly in the Zagros mountains high above the peaks of the Zagros fault found. The total length of 1,500 km range (932 miles) north of West .rshth Zagros Mountains in Iran and around the western border of Iran, and it spans the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending in Strait of Hormuz. Dena is the highest point in the Zagros Mountains
The Zagros mountain range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly corresponds to Iran's western border, and it spans the whole length of the western and southwestern Iranian plateau, ending at the Strait of Hormuz. The highest point in the Zagros Mountains is Dena. The mountains of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (4135 m), Kuh-i-Lalezar (4374 m) and Kuh-i-Hezar (4469 m) do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive.

The mountains are divided into many parallel sub-ranges (up to 10, or 250 km wide), and orogenically have the same age as the Alps. Iran's main oilfields lie in the western central foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The mountains of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar (4135 m), Kuh-i-Lalezar (4374 m) and Kuh-i-Hezar (4469 m) do not currently have glaciers. Only at Zard Kuh and Dena some glaciers still survive.
The Zagros fold and thrust belt (Zagros FTB) is an approximately 1,800-kilometre (1,100 mi) long zone of deformed crustal rocks, formed in the foreland of the collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The belt is also divided into zones from northeast to southwest. Next to the Main Zagros Reverse Fault is a zone sometimes referred to as the 'High Zagros', the highest part of the Zagros Mountains reaching heights in excess of 4500 m, with the 'High Zagros Fault' forming its southwestern boundary.
The Zagros Mountains in southwestern Iran present an impressive landscape of long linear ridges and valleys. Formed by collision of the Eurasian and Arabian tectonic plates, the ridges and valleys extend hundreds of kilometers. Stresses induced in the Earth’s crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered sedimentary rocks.
