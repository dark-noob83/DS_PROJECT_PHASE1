Traditionally, it is the bride's family that pays for the wedding; however, it is now common for the bride and groom to pay part of the costs themselves and the bride's family … to pay part. In some instances, the groom's family will pay for the rehearsal dinner costs. It is also common for the groom's family to pay for tuxedo rental for the groomsmen. But none of these are rules per se. Talk it over with each family to see what works best for you.
How to budget for a great wedding bash. Although traditionally the bride’s parents pay for much of the wedding, more and more couples are now paying for their own big day. Whatever your arrangements, as the groom you are traditionally responsible for some of the wedding day expenses.
A: Traditionally, the parents of the groom take care of a few of the expenses including: the marriage license, officiant's fee, corsages, boutonnieres, the bride's bouquet, groomsmen gifts, liquor, and the reception DJ or band. And the bride's parents pay for everything else. Then again, today's guidelines of who pays for what are very flexible -- many times, the parents of the bride and groom will split the wedding expenses in half, or sometimes into thirds, depending on whether the couple pitches in.
Traditionally, the groom or his parents pay for the bride’s engagement ring and wedding ring, while the bride and her family pay for the groom’s ring.
If the groom’s family can afford to pay all of the wedding expenses and the bride’s family is amenable, the wedding police won’t start issuing tickets. But tradition is sacrosanct for many couples, and the issue of who pays for the liquor at wedding receptions has launched some hot debates.
