Ad. There are several types of corynebacteria that do not cause diphtheria, commonly called non-diphtherial corynebacteria. Some of these bacteria can cause other types of infection in animals and humans, and these infections commonly affect the internal organs or the skin.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae are Gram-positive, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacteria that do not form spores or branch. They do not have a typical gram-postive cell wall. It consists of arabinose, galactose, disminopimelic acid, and short chain mycolic acids. In the mycolic acid, chains of 28-40 carbons are common.
Description and significance. Deaths caused by Corynebacterium Diphtheriae [16]. C. diphtheriae is a Gram-positive, aerobic, nonmotile, toxin-producing, rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales, which are typically found in soil, but also have pathogenic members such as streptomyces and mycobacteria.
Corynebacterium is a genus of bacteria that is very common in nature and can be found in soil, water, plants, animals, and humans. In humans, these bacteria are most commonly found in the skin and mucous membranes.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the etiological agent of diphtheria, an upper respiratory disease mainly affecting children. The virulence factors (most specifically diphtheria toxin) have been studied extensively and are well understood.
Corynebacteria are commonly rod or club-like in shape, and their name comes from the Greek word koryne, meaning club. Some corynebacteria do not cause infection or disease, and are used for a wide variety of industrial purposes, for example to produce amino acids, nucleotides, and enzymes.
