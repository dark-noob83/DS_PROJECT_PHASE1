Mitochondria (singular, mitochondrion) are organelles that carry out cellular respiration in nearly all eukaryotic cells, converting the chemical energy of foods such as sugar … s to the chemical energy of a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
Singular is mitochondrion ] are tiny structures found in cells (one is called a mitochondrion). Respiration [respire: To engage in respiration-the energy-producing process inside living cells ] , the chemical reaction that releases energy from glucose, happens in mitochondria.
Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O → 12H2O + 6 CO2. The energy released is trapped in the form of ATP for use by all the energy-consuming activities of the cell. 1  glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid.
This ATP production by the mitochondria is done by the process of respiration, which in essence is the use of oxygen in a process which generates energy. This is a very efficient process for using food energy to make ATP.
The reaction occurs in the cristae of the mitochondria is the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain allows animal and plant cells to produce usable energy. 8 people found this useful.
Image: Cell featuring mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny organelles inside cells that are involved in releasing energy from food. This process is known as cellular respiration. It is for this reason that mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell.
Plant cells are remarkable in that they have two organelles specialized for energy production: chloroplasts, which create energy via photosynthesis, and mitochondria, which generate energy through respiration, a particularly important process when light is unavailable.
