Lipids are organic compounds not soluble in water. They include fats and oils, cholesterol and some other substances. In relation to diet, lipids are thought of as fats that add calories and impact weight and health.
Food sources of saturated fats include butter, dairy products, meats and other animal products. Sources of cholesterol include meat, eggs and cheese. Food sources of trans fats include margarine, cookies, fried fast foods and many packaged snack foods. There are also fats that can benefit your health.
Eggs also contain fat-only the yolk. also junk food like chips, soda and cakes ect. The human body uses lipids, or fats, for insulation, to cushion organs and as a source of stored energy. Foods rich in lipids include pecans, peanuts, avocados, and tuna.
The three main types of lipids are triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and sterols. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) make up more than 95 percent of lipids in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil, butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.
In addition to their nutritional importance lipids are also used in foods because of their characteristic physicochemical properties, such as mouthfeel, flavor, texture and appearance. They are also used as heat transfer agents during the preparation of other foods, e.g. for frying.
Lipids are fats. Many foods contain fats. Most meat, poultry, seafood, and even fish. Most dairy products contain fats unless stated nonfat. In their natural state dairy contains fat. Cooking and salad oils contain fat.
Fats in our foods add flavor, texture and aroma. The smooth, creamy texture of ice cream can be attributed to fat, as can the flavor and aroma of bacon frying in a pan. Without fat, or lipids as they are also called, your diet would be very bland.
