1 Trinidad and Tobago investing in Jamaican LNG regasification terminal By Curtis Williams OGJ correspondent PORT OF SPAIN, Nov. 15 -- Trinidad and Tobago has agreed to take 40% interest in a Jamaican LNG regasification terminal slated for construction at Port Esquivel in Kingston by 2008.

The Freeport LNG terminal is a world-class regasification facility with a peak send-out capacity of more than 2.0 Bcf per day. The site is located approximately six miles from open water off a ship channel which is maintained at a depth of 45 feet, sufficient for all existing LNG carriers.

At the liquefaction terminal (left) natural gas is received by pipeline from a well field, liquefied, stored and loaded onto LNG carrier ships. At the regasification terminal (right) LNG is offloaded into storage tanks, regasified and placed into storage.
Introduction to LNG - 5 - exporting countries) and shipping cost (primarily a function of distance). 2 This price range incorporates an estimated 30 percent escalation over CEE’s 2003 estimate of $2.00-3.70/MMBtu, a consequence of cost pressure in recent years associated with higher energy and commodity prices.
The total capacity contribution of FLNG regasification terminals to the global LNG regasification market is expected to increase from 5.4% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2015. Such growth can largely be attributed to strong demand for natural gas during 2005 to 2010, which is expected to continue until 2015.
LNG has some fixed costs above and beyond the cost of the raw natural gas. These costs are typically amortized over 20 years. The most significant of those fixed costs are: 1) Liquification plant $1.1 per Mcf +/- $0.20. 2) Shipping costs (LNG tankers and operating costs) $0.70 per Mcf +/- $0.30 depending on distance. 3) Cost for regasification $0.35 per Mcf. The costs come out to $2.15 per Mcf.
If each well produces less, then the costs are higher. Based on the costs of some of the conventional natural gas fields I’ve looked at, I think that the average cost will vary between $0.75 to $2.00 per mcf for most large conventional natural gas fields.
Note that the costs would be lower for oil and gas fields where the primary reason to drill the well was to produce the oil. Adding up everything, the cost to get LNG to market is in the range of around $2.90 to $4.15 per Mcf.
