10 hilariously insightful foreign words. A tau protein is a protein found in neurons, primarily in the central nervous system. Several different versions or isoforms of tau protein can be found in the body, and all are critical to the healthy functioning of a normal nervous system. Tau protein interacts with a compound called tubulin to strengthen the neural tubes in the axons of neurons. Engaging in brain-healthy activities such as reading may help prevent Alzheimer's disease.
An age-related brain disorder, Alzheimer's gradually erodes a person's memory, thinking, and behavior. Plaque made of beta-amyloid protein fragments and tangles formed from tau proteins are familiar hallmarks of disease in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Tau is found inside brain cells and its role is to provide a structure — like a train track — to help the cells clear any accumulation of unwanted and toxic proteins. Moussa's animal experiments show less plaques accumulate outside the brain cells when tau is functioning.
Transcript: Tau is the protein that is formed in the neurofibrillary tangle, but tau is also a normal protein that we all have in our brain. It is mostly present in the axon of a neuron, the part that is projecting a long distance. In the axon, it is attached to the microtubules. You can think of tau as the ties along railroad tracks, with the railroad tracks being the microtubules and the ties being the tau protein. The purpose of this system of tau and microtubules is for moving cargo down these long distances, the long axons
An abnormal tau protein can cause tangles inside the nerve cells of a person with Alzheimer's and swollen nerve cells in people who have Pick's disease or corticobasal degeneration. The tau protein stabilizes the structure within the nerve cells that the cells need to divide, carry substances and use for support.
Tau proteins (or τ proteins, after the Greek letter by that name) are proteins that stabilize microtubules. They are abundant in neurons of the central nervous system and are less common elsewhere, but are also expressed at very low levels in CNS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Tau protein is a highly soluble microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In humans, these proteins are found mostly in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells. One of tau's main functions is to modulate the stability of axonal microtubules.
The tau proteins are the product of alternative splicing from a single gene that in humans is designated MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and is located on chromosome 17. They were discovered in 1975 in Marc Kirschner 's laboratory at Princeton University. Tau protein is a highly soluble microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In humans, these proteins are found mostly in neurons compared to non-neuronal cells. One of tau's main functions is to modulate the stability of axonal microtubules.
