Location: Toronto, ON. From what OSAP reps told me, only RESP funds you have access to are reported. Also, if you have savings, that will affect the amount OSAP lends/grants you. What I recommend is if your account is student account under your parents, you do not claim is as your own. After all, it's under your parents name, right?
If your OSAP funding consists of both federal and provincial loans and/or grants, there will be more than one deposit on separate days to your bank account.

They care about how much is in your bank account as OSAP is need based-meaning that if you have money that is sitting there unused, it has to go towards school. $10-15k is a lot of money-you'll probably be denied OSAP or given a very limited amount. By the time i go back to school after a year, I'll have around 10~15k saved up and I was just wondering if I had this money seating in my bank account, could I be declined of my osap? or my grant for that matter?
