The Euglena Euglena are unicellular organisms classified into the Kingdom Protista, and the Phylum Euglenophyta. All euglena have chloroplasts and can make their own food by photosynthesis.
The Amoeba, Paramecium, Euglena, and Volvox All are protists: eukaryotes that cannot be classified as animals, plants, or fungi. Classified by their movement and way of life.
Description: Volvox is a green algae and the culmination of the volvocine line. It is a hollow sphere made up of a single layer of 500-60,000 biflagellate cells. The flagella beat so as to turn the volvox in circles and therefore propel the spheres in water. Volvox is also polar.
Volvox (Protists). Straddling the plant and animal kingdoms, the protist Volvox forms stunning bright green colonial balls in water bodies that are enriched in nitrates. Found in puddles, ditches, shallow ponds and bogs, Volvox colonies reach up to 50,000 cells and may include daughter and granddaughter colonies. Volvox Video #1. Spherical colonies of bright green Volvox cells rotate in unison; under oblique illumination with a playing time of 32 seconds.
Algae can be classified into the Protista kingdom and further into the Phacophyta division. Another name for the Phacophyta division is the common title, brown algae. Algae play the ecological roles of a decomposer, producer and a food source.
