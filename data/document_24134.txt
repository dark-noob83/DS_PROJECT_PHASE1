Cows and other animals farmed for their milk carry potentially harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella, Listeria and E. coli, which can be secreted in their milk. These potentially harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of people who drink raw milk or eat foods made from raw milk such as unpasteurized cheese.
Unpasteurized cheese contains bacteria. Unpasteurized cheese is made from raw milk that has not been subjected to pasteurization, which is a process that sterilizes the milk. Unpasteurized milk contains bacteria, some of which are friendly, some of which may be pathogenic or disease-causing.
If the cheese is made from pasteurized milk, it's fine. But some cheese is made with raw (unpasteurized) milk, and it's not safe to eat or drink anything made with raw milk during pregnancy.
Pasteurized cheese is defined as cheese produced with milk that has been heated to a temperature of 161° F for fifteen seconds or to 145° F for thirty minutes or more. Cheese made with unpasteurized (raw) milk can't be sold in the USA unless it has been aged for at least 60 days.
Unpasteurized cheese, also known as raw-milk cheese, is made from milk that has not been pasteurized. Pasteurization occurs during cheesemaking when milk is heated at the beginning of the cheesemaking process to destroy microorganisims that can potentially cause sickness or spoilage.
Whether or not to use unpasteurized milk to make cheese is a hotly contested debate in the world of cheesemaking and among cheese consumers. Some argue that raw milk gives cheese better flavor and others claim that cheese made from pasteurized milk can be just as delicious and satisfying.
Raw-milk cheese is made with milk that is unpasteurized. Since 1949, the US government has forbidden the sale of cheeses made from unpasteurized milk unless the cheese is aged at least 60 days. The 60-day ban is meant to protect consumers from potentially harmful pathogens.
