Restriction enzymes, also known as restriction endonucleases, are enzymes that cut a DNA molecule at a particular place. They are essential tools for recombinant DNA technology. The enzyme scans a DNA molecule, looking for a particular sequence, usually of four to six nucleotides.
Restriction enzymes are DNA-cutting enzymes found in bacteria (and harvested from them for use). Because they cut within the molecule, they are often called restriction endonucleases. In order to be able to sequence DNA, it is first necessary to cut it into smaller fragments.
A restriction enzyme is a protein that recognizes a specific, short nucleotide sequence and cuts the DNA only at that specific site, which is known as restriction site or target sequence. More than 400 restriction enzymes have been isolated from the bacteria that manufacture them.
Restriction enzyme. Like all enzymes, a restriction enzyme works by shape-to-shape matching. When it comes into contact with a DNA sequence with a shape that matches a part of the enzyme, called the recognition site, it wraps around the DNA and causes a break in both strands of the DNA molecule.
The discovery of enzymes that could cut and paste DNA made genetic engineering possible. Restriction enzymes, found naturally in bacteria, can be used to cut DNA fragments at specific sequences, while another enzyme, DNA ligase, can attach or rejoin DNA fragments with complementary ends.
When a restriction enzyme cleaves a restriction site, the reaction creates highly reactive sticky ends on the broken DNA. This is useful to the biotechnologist! By cutting open vector DNA with the same with restriction enzymes used to cleave the target DNA, complementary sticky ends are created.
Restriction enzyme: An enzyme from bacteria that can recognize specific base sequences in DNA and cut the DNA at that site (the restriction site). A restriction enzyme acts as a biochemical scissors. Also called a restriction endonuclease.
