It is a near twin of Earth in size, mass, and density. Venus's diameter is about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), compared with some 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. Its mass is approximately 80 percent of Earth's, and its density is about 95 percent of Earth's. The surface gravity of the two planets is also of similar. Venus...
The equatorial diameter is about 12,104 miles, or about 95% of Earth's. (More precisely 12103.6 km.) This is also the polar diameter since Venus's very slow rotation does not … produce any significant bulge of the equator as on the other, rapidly rotating planets. The diameter of Venus, the second planet from the sun, is approximately 12,103.6 kilometers. This is very close to Earth's diameter (12,756.6 km).
Density, mass, and volume. Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet like Earth, and likely formed the same way at the same time. It has a mass of 4.87 trillion trillion kilograms, about 82 percent that of its sister planet. Like its size, its density is comparable to Earth at 5.243 grams per cubic centimeter. Often called Earth's sister planet, Venus is the closest in size, with a mass of more than 80 percent that of our planet and a diameter of only a few miles less.
Radius, diameter and circumference. Venus has a mean radius of 3,760 miles, or 6,052 kilometers. Most planets in the solar system, including Earth, spin so rapidly that they bulge slightly at the middle, creating a radius that differs at the poles and the equator. Often called Earth's sister planet, Venus is the closest in size, with a mass of more than 80 percent that of our planet and a diameter of only a few miles less.
Mercury is the only other planet that has a density similar to Earth’s. Venus is the only planet which is similar in more ways then one. Because of this, Venus has been referred to as Earth’s twin. The diameter of Venus is 7,521 miles or 12,104 kilometers. This is close to the 7,926 miles or 12,756 km diameter of the Earth. Venus’ mass is roughly 80 percent that of Earth’s. 95% of Earth’s density is the density of Venus. The force of gravity of both planets is similar.
Venus is 12103.6 kilometers in diameter from any reference. (Its slow spin does not produce a bulge.) Earth ha … s an equatorial diameter of about 12756.2 kilometers and a polar diameter of about 12713.6 kilometers. The diameter of Venus, the second planet from the sun, is approximately 12,103.6 kilometers. This is very close to Earth's diameter (12,756.6 km).
The entire diameter of Venus is covered in volcanoes and the remnants of volcanoes. There are 1,000 of them that are over 20 km in diameter scattered among thousands of smaller ones. There are some large impact craters, but no small ones. That is a lot of information to throw at you. Again, the diameter of Venus is 12,100 km and is very close to that of Earth. Hopefully, you found all of the information that you need and good luck with any further research you need to do.
Venus has a diameter that is about 95% of Earth’s. It is 12,100 km across. The Venusian surface area is around 90% of our own at 4.6×10 8 km 2. The planet has a volume of 9.38×10 11 km 3. That puts it a little over 85% of Earth’s volume. One final way to measure the size of Venus is to consider its mass. 
The diameter of Venus is 12,100 km. That is 95% of the diameter of Earth. There are many similarities between the two planets, but there are many more extreme differences. Venus and Earth are two of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System. Mercury and Mars are the other two. Venus has a surface gravity that is 8.87 m/s 2 or 90% of the gravity here on Earth. The planet has 86% of the volume that Earth has along with 82% of the mass. That is a lot of information to throw at you. Again, the diameter of Venus is 12,100 km and is very close to that of Earth. Hopefully, you found all of the information that you need and good luck with any further research you need to do.
The diameter of Venus is about 12103.6 kilometers or 7520.8 miles. The very slow (clockwise) spin of the planet means that there is no appreciable equatorial bulge as is created on Earth and the other planets. The radius of the planet is relatively uniform at approximately 3760 miles. (see related question). The diameter of Venus, the second planet from the sun, is approximately 12,103.6 kilometers. This is very close to Earth's diameter (12,756.6 km).
