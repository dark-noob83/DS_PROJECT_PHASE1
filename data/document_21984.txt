Note the large amount of calcium in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex arteries. Coronary artery calcification-CT. Section caudal to that in the previous image shows calcium in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery as it courses down the front of the heart.
No calcium (pink) is present in the LAD or diagonal branch. Coronary artery calcification-CT. Image obtained in a patient with a large amount of calcium in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Note that other hyperattenuating structures (eg, bone, calcified lymph nodes) are pink.
The measurement of coronary artery calcification (CAC) by computed tomography (CT) has received considerable attention for diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected coronary artery disease.
Conditions that can cause myocardial ischemia include: 1  Coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis). 2  Plaques made up mostly of cholesterol build up on your artery walls and restrict blood flow. 3  Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of myocardial ischemia.
Discussion. This study is the first to describe the relationship between severity of coronary artery calcification detected by EBCT and the presence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia in a large cohort of predominantly asymptomatic subjects with risk factors for CAD development.
Coronary artery disease is a blockage or narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, often due to a buildup of fatty plaque inside the arteries. A severe enough blockage may cause a heart attack. If not quickly treated, the blockage can cause parts of the heart muscle to die.
The role of coronary artery calcification (CAC) detection in individuals undergoing medical therapy is controversial. These patients frequently exhibit an artificially low clinical suspicion for obstructive heart disease. Whether detection of CAC adds value to their assessment is unknown.
