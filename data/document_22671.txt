On the opposite end of woven is non-woven. These geotextiles are manufactured by bonding with needle punching, chemically, or heat, or by entangling fibres of plastic. Its excellent filtration and drainage makes it ideal for pond underlaymen t, erosion control, speration fabric, and drainage fabric.
The most common types of geotextiles are woven and non woven. A woven geotextile could be used for sediment control, unpaved road bases, strengthening paved roads, erosion protection, and subsurface drainage. It possesses the following features: 1  Woven Polypropylene. 2  UV Resistant. 3  Rot
One of the most popular options for drainage, filtration and stabilization is the Nonwoven Geotextile Fabric. Constructed from a felt-like fabric, these geotextiles are light in weight and able to both filter and reinforce a construction areas.
Geotextiles also often are used for erosion control on slopes because they are able to hold soil in place while allowing water to pass in and out of the soil; the free passage of water eliminates a buildup of soil water pressure that can destabilize the slope.
Geotextile composites have been introduced and products such as geogrids and meshes have been developed. Overall, these materials are referred to as geosynthetics and each configuration—- geonets, geogrids, geotubes (such as TITANTubes) and others—-can yield benefits in geotechnical and environmental engineering design.
A geotextile is a synthetic permeable textile material used with soil, rock, or any other geotechnical engineering related material. Geotextiles, also called geosynthetics, are generally associated with high-standard all-season roads, but can be used in low-standard logging roads.
Landscape fabric and drainfield fabric are geotextiles, but they are different products intended for very different uses; landscape fabric is used mainly as a physical barrier, and drainfield fabric is used as a filter.
