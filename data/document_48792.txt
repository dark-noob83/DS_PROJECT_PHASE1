Scribe molding is a piece of wood that is used to cover inconsistencies between cabinet units and walls or ceilings. It lends a finished look to the cabinet’s appearance. Scribe molding is a thin strip of wood that covers gaps or inconsistencies where the cabinet meets the ceiling or wall. The piece of wood is typically straight on the end that is placed against the wall, but the other end is curved to fit the cabinet.
