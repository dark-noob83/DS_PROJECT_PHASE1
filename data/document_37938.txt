The very first James Bond film was a 1954 TV movie version of Casino Royale. However, the first Bond film made by Eon Productions was Dr. No in 1962, starring Sean Connery.
The first James Bond movie ever made was Dr. No. It was released in 1962 and starred Sean Connery as James Bond. Ursula Andress played the first ‘Bond girl’. The movie cost only $1.1 million to make and made $59.6 million at the box office.
Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli started the official cinematic run of Bond in 1962, with Dr. No starring Sean Connery. The films made by their production company, EON Productions are regarded as the official films by all parties, although the three unofficial adaptations were authorised to be made.
The first movie was Dr. No. Dr. No is a 1962 spy film. It is the first film in the James Bond series, and the first to star Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. Based on the 1958 novel Dr. No by Ian Fleming, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkeley Mather.
The first James Bond film to win an Oscar took its title from a man 007 creator Ian Fleming used to know called Ernő Goldfinger. He was the cousin (by marriage) of Fleming’s golf partner, John Blackwell, and threatened to sue over the use of his name.
Casino Royale was the first Bond novel written by Ian Flemming. It was also the first to be dramatized, being shown on TV by NBC in 1954. This production featured Barry Nelson and an American James Bond. The Casino Royale movie comedy with David Niven was made in 67 and is not an official Bond film. I concur with mk2norwich; Dr No was the first.
