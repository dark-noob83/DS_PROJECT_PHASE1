Federal Contract Interpreters. The amount of money that a court interpreter makes varies in the federal court system, according to United States Courts. Certified and professionally qualified interpreters who work on a contract basis make $388 per day, as of February 2010. If they work a half-day, they make $210. The overtime rate for certified and professionally qualified interpreters is $55 per hour, as of February 2010. Language-skilled non-certified interpreters make $187 for a full day, as of February 2010. The half-day rate is $103. Overtime pay for language-skilled non-certified interpreters is $33 per hour. Court interpreters in nearby Orange County, California, earn the comparable rate of $282 per day, as of 2012. Independent court interpreters working in the New York State Unified Court System make $250 per day, as of March 2012.
Certification. As with many vocations, certifications improve salaries for ASL interpreters. A professional certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, or RID, can increase hourly wages to as much as $30 to $35 per hour, or $62,000 to $73,000 per year. But this figure accounts for all interpreters and translators. American Sign Language interpreters earn closer to $39,000, or $18.85 per hour, according to Bridgerland Applied Technology College.
Court interpreters who work independently charge daily or hourly rates. According to the United States Courts website, the daily rate for non-certified court interpreters was $187 as of 2010. For a half-day, the rate was $103. Certified interpreters earned $388 for a full day and $210 for half a day.

The same can also be said for Boston, Massachusetts, where workers tend to make 32 percent more per year. But this figure accounts for all interpreters and translators.
