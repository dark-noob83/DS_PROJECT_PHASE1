There are several versions on YouTube. One (Volver song by Raimunda) is taken directly from the movie (with the movie's soundtrack) but is only the second half of the song. Another (Volver-Estrella Morente-y Letras) contains the full song and captions/subtitles for the lyrics (with one small error). A web search can turn up several other versions of the lyrics but some of them have lots of mistakes. For me this song is somewhat unusual. I'm a big fan of Flamenco (especially the songs) but, for the most part, they they seem to consist of a few short verses and a chorus (with everything repeated).
