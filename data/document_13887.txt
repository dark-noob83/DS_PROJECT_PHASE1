A decline in testosterone is often blamed for men's loss of muscle, energy and sex drive as they get older, but the culprit for some age-related changes may be a drop in men's levels of the female hormone estrogen, a new study suggests.
We know that fertility does decline. We know that after the age of 30, there is a drop in testosterone of 1 percent a year. Testosterone is the energy, the hormone that you need to make good-quality sperm. It takes much longer for an older man to have children.
Aging in men is associated with a one percent decline in total testosterone level each year starting at around age forty. About twenty percent of men in their sixties and fifty percent of men in their eighties have a testosterone level significantly below normal.
1 Testosterone levels in men naturally decline with age – beginning at age 30 – and continue to do so as men advance in years. 2  Unfortunately, widespread chemical exposure is causing this decline to occur in men as early as childhood.
Reviewed by Laura J. Martin, MD. June 7, 2011 -- Testosterone decline is not inevitable with age, according to Australian scientists. Older men in excellent health can maintain their hormone levels, they say.
Testosterone levels in men naturally decline with age – beginning at age 30 – and continue to do so as men advance in years. Aging-induced testosterone decline is associated with the overactivity of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Serum testosterone levels gradually decline as men age, but the degree to which this happens, as well as the extent of associated clinical changes, is variable.
Men in their 20s or 30s can expect to have a testosterone level of 270 to 1,080 ng/dL. From 40 to 59 years of age, testosterone levels drop to between 350 and 890 ng/dL. From 60 years on, a typical testosterone level in men is between 350 and 720 ng/dL.
