Input: 100-240 V AC; 50/60 Hz. That tells you the voltage the device will take. If it says 110V but there is no mention of 240V, your device is not dual voltage and you will need an electricity converter in China.
Electricity in China is 220 Volts, alternating at 50 cycles per second. This is twice the standard voltage than in North America and some Latin American countries which run on 110V 60Hz.
Electrical sockets (outlets) in the People's Republic of China usually supply electricity at between 220 and 240 volts AC. If you're plugging in an appliance that was built for 220-240 volt electrical input, or an appliance that is compatible with multiple voltages, then an adapter is all you need.
Here is a short list of the country voltage. There is slight difference in voltage in each country due to the many factors like demand. At this time there are countries that were using 220 V that are converting to the 230 V, which is the EU Standard.
Voltage in Mainland China is 220V, 50 Hz. A variety of electrical outlets can be found in China. A common type of outlet is shown at right. This outlet can accept the standard Type A and common Type I plugs as well as Type C plugs.
Desktop computer: Usually switchable between 110-120V and 220-240V via a small switch on the back of the computer, near the cooling fan. A travel plug adapter will work fine as long as the voltage switch is set to the proper position.
The input voltage is usually abbreviated to V and it should look something like this: Input: ~100-240V 50/60Hz 65W -- This means the appliance is compatible with multiple voltages. This item can be brought just about anywhere in the world, and any difference in voltage is basically irrelevant. The appliance (or charger) adjusts itself to whatever voltage it receives.
120 and 220 Volt; 60 Hertz (USA). 230 Volt; 50 Hertz (Europe & Asia). Because the electrical current is dependent of the Voltage and the Hertz you cannot connect electrical equipment with a motor and or transformer in it, to a Voltage other then stated on the nameplate.
