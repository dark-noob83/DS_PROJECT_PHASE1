If your state offers this tax break, you only pay sales tax on the difference between the price of the new car and the value of the old car. For example, if you are trading in a $6,000 car to buy a $24,000 car, and your state offers this tax break, you would only pay sales tax on $18,000, not $24,000. Find out what the state, local and county sales tax rates are for your area (see Resources). Multiply the sales tax rate by your taxable purchase price. For example, if the total of state, county and local taxes was 8 percent and the total taxable cost of your car was $18,000, your sales tax would be $1,440. Ascertain the final sales price of your car. Find out if your state taxes dealer incentives or not. For example, if your state taxes them and your new car's price is dropped by $1,000 due to a manufacturer's rebate, you have to pay sales tax on that $1,000, though it was not part of the sales price.
