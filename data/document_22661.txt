RE: What is the formula of magnesium sulphate hydrate? given that's it hydrate mass is 3.228g and it's anhydrous mass is 1.654g and therefore the mass of water 1.574g what is the molecular formula for MgSO4 · x H2O. Best Answer: Relative Formula Mass(MgSO4 (anh)) = 24.3 + 32 + 64 = 120.3 Moles MgSO4 (anh)) = 1.654/120.3 = 0.013749 moles Moles H2O = 1.574/18 = 0.0874444 moles Mole Ratio moles H20/ moles MgSO4 (anh)) = 0.0874444/0.013749 = 6.36: 1 Should have been very close to 7.
Magnesium sulfate is a common mineral pharmaceutical preparation of magnesium, commonly known as Epsom salt, used both externally and internally. Epsom salt is used as bath salts and for isolation tanks. Magnesium sulfate is used as the electrolyte to prepare copper sulfate. A magnesium sulfate solution is electrolyzed with a copper anode to form copper sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, and hydrogen:

Magnesium sulfate (or magnesium sulphate) is an inorganic salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium, sulfur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO 4. Magnesium sulfate is used as the electrolyte to prepare copper sulfate. A magnesium sulfate solution is electrolyzed with a copper anode to form copper sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, and hydrogen:
Magnesium is a mineral that is present in relatively large amounts in the body. Researchers estimate that the average person’s body contains about 25 grams of magnesium, and about half of that is in the bones. Magnesium is important in more than 300 chemical reactions that keep the body working properly.
There are many forms of Magnesium (Mg Oxide, Mg Stearate etc). This particular product is Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (Hex meaning 6, and hydrate meaning water), it will attract water to itself. Because of that it is sometimes referred to as an oil, although it is not an oil: rather it is water based. 
An easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think fiber. Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or “hard” water, is also a source of magnesium. Researchers estimate that the average person’s body contains about 25 grams of magnesium, and about half of that is in the bones. Magnesium is important in more than 300 chemical reactions that keep the body working properly.
Magnesium sulfate is highly soluble in water. The anhydrous form is strongly hygroscopic, and can be used as a desiccant. It is the primary substance that causes the absorption of sound in seawater (acoustic energy is converted to thermal energy). Magnesium sulfate is used as the electrolyte to prepare copper sulfate. A magnesium sulfate solution is electrolyzed with a copper anode to form copper sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, and hydrogen:
Discussion. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the empirical formula of a hydrate. Hydrates are inorganic salts which contain a specific number of water molecules loosly attached. Examples are: magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (epsom salts) and sodium carbonate decahydrate (washing soda).
