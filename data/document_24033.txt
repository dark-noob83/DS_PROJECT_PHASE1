Catapult physics is basically the use of stored energy to hurl a projectile (the payload), without the use of an explosive. The three primary energy storage mechanisms are tension, torsion, and gravity. The catapult has proven to be a very effective weapon during ancient times, capable of inflicting great damage.
Catapult. A catapult is a device used to throw or hurl a projectile a great distance without the aid of explosive devices—particularly various types of ancient and medieval siege engines. Although the catapult has been used since ancient times, it has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare.
depends on what type of catapult: Trebuchet: lowering the throwing arm raises the weighted end, increasing the gravitational potential of the weighted end. when the catapult i … s released, gravitational potential energy is turned into kenetic energy thus overcoming the inertia of the projectile.
The noun CATAPULT has 3 senses: 1. a plaything consisting of a Y-shaped stick with elastic between the arms; used to propel small stones. 2. a device that launches aircraft from a warship. 3. medieval artillery used during sieges; a heavy war engine for hurling large stones and other missiles.
A trebuchet tends to be easier to build because it consists simply of a pivoting beam and a counterweight that rotates the beam through an arc. Catapults can launch things a fair distance -- 500 to 1,000 feet (150 to 300 meters) is common. It is surprising how much energy they can store.
3. A trebuchet is a weighted beam that swings a sling carrying the projectile (see this page for pictures). ­Both catapults and ballistas work by storing tension either in twisted ropes or in a flexed piece of wood (in the same way an archery bow does, but on a larger scale).
