One fluid ounce of whole milk (which is a lot more than most people put in their tea) has only 18 calories, 9 of which are from fat. Half-and-half has 39 calories per fluid ounce, 30 of which are from fat. Skim milk has 10 calories per fluid ounce, none of which is from fat.
A typical teaspoon of refined (white) sugar amounts to about 4 grams of sugar, which has 15 calories. A typical sugar cube is about 2 grams, which has about 9 calories, and a typical sugar packet, like those served with tea or coffee in some restaurants, has about 3 grams, or 11 calories.
Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time. 1 teaspoon of sugar is about 15 calories, and depending on the milk (fat free, 2% fat) about 10 calories. Black tea has little to no calories so about 25 calories in one cup of tea.
A cup of tea without sugar and without milk will have zero calories. Milk can add 10-50 calories, depending on how much milk is added and whether the milk is skim, 1%, 2 … % or whole. Cream could add more calories, up to 70 depending on variety and quantity.
Fats. By itself or with sugar, tea contains no fat. Add 1 tablespoon of 2 percent milk and you’ll add 8 calories and approximately 1/3 gram of fat. Whole milk will add a couple more calories and an insignificant amount of extra fat. If you make lattes with your tea, using 1 cup of 2 percent milk, you’ll add 120 calories and 5 grams of fat.
