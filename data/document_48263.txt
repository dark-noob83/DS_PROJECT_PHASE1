Transmission Slip Out Of Gear problem of the 2007 Mercury Mariner 1. Failure Date: 08/04/2014. The vehicle had been driving perfectly normal all day. In the evening, while driving in a heavily-trafficked area, unexpectedly our Mariner would not shift out of 1st gear-the engine revved, but the car would just barely move. It finally shifted into 3rd gear, but never would go into 4th.

I have a '97 Merc 25 HP shift on the handle / throttle. Here at the lake turkey hunting and last night went to shift it into gear and nothing. Took cover off, can see all parts moving freely, shifting in forward and reverse. Actually, it now shifts into forward and reverse more freely now, with no resistance. However prop will not turn, nothing engages.
