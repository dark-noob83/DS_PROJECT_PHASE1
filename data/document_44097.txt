[riˈkɔtta] in Italian) is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep (or cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo) milk whey left over from the production of cheese. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to ferment for approximately a year, during which the cheese is mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold.
Fresh Ricotta. Ricotta is an Italian fresh cheese made from sheep, cow, goat or buffalo’s milk whey left over from the production of cheese. Since the casein is filtered away from whey during cheese making process, Ricotta is suitable for persons with casein intolerance. Being low in fat and high in protein, Ricotta is a dieter’s dream cheese. Traditional Italian fresh ricotta is smoother than cottage cheese and tastes mildly sweet.
—L.C., Beaubier, SaskatchewanWhen a cheese maker separates milk or cream into curds and whey, the curds are used to make cottage cheese and the whey is used to make ricotta. That's why both cheeses, although similarly soft and mild in flavor, have such different textures. Both are considered fresh or unripened cheeses. They can be used in many recipes interchangeably, but there are some distinct differences. Ricotta is a soft cheese that has a fine, moist, grainy texture. Cottage cheese is lumpier, whether the curds are small or large.
Ricotta (literally meaning recooked) protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by letting it sit for 12–24 hours at room temperature). Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to ferment for approximately a year, during which the cheese is mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold.
A rich fresh cheese made from skim or whole cow's milk that is slightly grainy but smoother than cottage cheese. It's white, moist and has a slightly sweet flavor. Most Italian ricottas are made from the whey that is drained off while making cheeses such as mozzarella and provolone.

Ricotta differs from other cheeses because it is made from whey, which is usually a byproduct of the cheese making process. Liquid whey is heated to a high temperature at which point an acid is introduced to denature and curdle the whey proteins. The resulting curd is ricotta cheese. Ricotta is a fresh, soft, Italian cheese with a small curd and a light, mild flavor. It is considered a fresh cheese because it does not undergo an ageing or ripening process to further develop the flavor
September 7, 2012 in Cooking, Ingredients 1 Comment. Ricotta cheese is a fresh cheese with creamy, fine textured curds that is very commonly used in many types of recipes, from savory pasta dishes to decadent cheesecakes. The name “ricotta” translates to “recooked.” The cheese gets its name because it is made with the whey leftover from other cheesemaking processes, which is recooked with an acid until the proteins left in the whey come together and fine curds form.
