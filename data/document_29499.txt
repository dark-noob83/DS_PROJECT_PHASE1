Although at the 1095 Council of Clermont Urban II compared the Iberian wars to his First Crusade, it was not until Pope Callixtus II 's 1123 encyclical that they attained crusade status. After the encyclical, the papacy declared Iberian crusades in 1147, 1193, 1197, 1210, 1212, 1221, and 1229. In 1095 Byzantine Emperor Alexios I, in Constantinople, sent an ambassador to Pope Urban II in Italy pleading for military help against the growing Turkish threat. The Pope responded promptly by calling Catholic soldiers to join the First Crusade.

The People's, or Peasants', Crusade: By the spring of 1096, before the First Crusade was officially launched, Peter the Hermit and other wandering preachers had collected a number of motley armies, composed of peasants, vagrants, beggars, women, and children. The Sixth {1248 - 1254} and Seventh {1270} Crusades, led by the devout Louis IX of France, failed to liberate the Holy City, which remained in Moslem hands until World War I. The fall of Acre in 1291 put an end to Christian rule in the Holy Land.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Ninth Crusade, which is sometimes grouped with the Eighth Crusade, is commonly considered to be the last major medieval Crusade to the Holy Land. It took place in 1271–1272. Louis IX of France 's failure to capture Tunis in the Eighth Crusade led Henry III of England 's son Edward to sail to Acre in what is known as the Ninth Crusade. The Ninth Crusade saw several impressive victories for Edward over Baibars. Ultimately the Crusade did not so much fail as withdraw, since Edward had pressing concerns at home and felt unable to resolve the internal conflicts within the remnant Outremer territories

After a long series of losses in Palestine, there was little stomach left for further adventures in Palestine. The Crusades started in 1095, and ended in 1291. They actually started in 1096 and ended in 1270. no your both wrong they REALLY started in 1100 and ended in 1300.. Well … the first two are sort of right.. start year from the first one (1095) is correct and the end year from the second (1270) is correct
The first crusade was launched by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095. There is controversy over the last crusade. Traditionalists would end the crusades in 1291 with the fall of the last crusader castle of the Latin Kingdom, the city of Acre (on the northern coast of present-day Israel). Pluralists disagree, but one good candidate would be the Spanish Armada of 1588. The crusades were a series of holy wars called by popes with the promise of indulgences for those who fought in them and directed against external and internal enemies of Christendom for the recovery of Christian property or in defense of the Church or Christian people.
A traditional numbering scheme for the crusades totals nine during the 11th to 13th centuries. This division is arbitrary and excludes many important expeditions, among them those of the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. In reality, the crusades continued until the end of the 17th century.
