This code is adapted from the example given in the VBA Help files for the GetSaveAsFilename amd SaveAs methods. I put it inside the Workbook_Open event so that the Save As dialog box opens whenever the workbook is opened. As written, it does not prevent the user from canceling the Save As, so that would have to be added if needed. 1 - Use Alt-F11 to open the VBA editor. 2 - Double-click the ThisWorkbook entry under the VBA Project list. 3 - Paste the following code into the pane that opens and save the file. 
1 The Save As dialog box opens, with the current folder selected. 2  You can select a different folder in which to save the file. 3  The default name is the sheet name, with spaces and periods replaced by underscores, followed by the date and time. 4  You can enter a different name, or leave the default name. The following code will export the active sheet in PDF format. 1  The Save As dialog box opens, with the current folder selected. 2  You can select a different folder in which to save the file. 3  The default name is the sheet name, with spaces and periods replaced by underscores, followed by the date and time.
I recorded one that works but it always saves the document with the same name which means it overwrites the previous document I used the macro with, and doesn't let me choose the name anyway. So I want a prompt box to appear to be able to write in the name. For example the following macro will add RES to the start of the original filename and save all the documents (docx) as TXT in a folder to a sub folder (which it will create if not present) called Text.
SUMMARY. In Microsoft Excel, you can save a file to any drive to which you have write and delete privileges. In addition, you can use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro to save the active workbook and use a variable for the file name. You can use variables from the ActiveWorkbook.Name property, from input box data, or from a cell reference. NOTE: If you use the full path for the file name, Microsoft Excel will know exactly where to save the file. If the path is not given, Microsoft Excel will save the file to the currently active directory or folder.
The prompt is a 'Save as' box, with the right location and name that I made already there, so that you only have to press 'Save'. fNameOld is made with Application.GetSaveAsFilename – RMulder Jan 9 at 11:46. @Jean-FrançoisCorbett: Françoiscorbett Yes i see my mistake, now'shouldn t have Used.GetSaveAsFilename! getsaveasfilename However, even though I'm using SaveAs, excel keeps giving me this prompt to confirm that I want to save the original file under the name that I gave it. I've already tried: Oldbook.Saved = True. SaveChanges = True. Application.DisplayAlerts = False. None work.
Examples. Below are two basic code examples to copy the ActiveSheet to a new Workbook and save it in a format that matches the file extension of the parent workbook. The second example use GetSaveAsFilename to ask you for a file path/name. Example 1 you can use in Excel 97-2013, Example 2 you can use in Excel 2000-2013. If you run the code in Excel 2007-2013 it will look at the FileFormat of the parent workbook and save the new file in that format. Only if the parent workbook is an xlsm file and if there is no VBA code in the new workbook it will save the new file as xlsx. 
SaveAs without prompt to save. up vote 1 down vote favorite. I have this excel macro with which I make a copy of a file (Newbook), change it and and save the original (Oldbook) under a new name. However, even though I'm using SaveAs, excel keeps giving me this prompt to confirm that I want to save the original file under the name that I gave it. I've already tried: Oldbook.Saved = True. SaveChanges = True. Application.DisplayAlerts = False. None work.
One last question. is there a vba code for file save path (which will not give a prompt if it exist and that is what i want) or is the code file saveas path (which if it exist i will be prompted). ex: no matter what the file name is or what was the last directory you obtained the file from to save the active file as abc.xls to c:\documents\files. I recorded it and it uses Chdir but it doesn't work all the time. Also I want it to save and overwrite not save as.
VBA Code to prompt for filename to be imported. Hi there, I have an excel that runs some macro on data that's being imported and then gets refreshed on a regular basis. What I do is import the data from a txt file, run macro on it, refresh data, run macro etc. The loop for running the macro and the refresh is done, what I'd like to do is have Excel prompt me to load the file, as for the moment I'm doing that manually. So now: 1. Open excel file that contains macro 2
