Mike Thomas/Yukon News. ANCIENT IVORY... Yukon palaeontologist Grant Zazula holds up a 30,000-year-old mammoth tusk found in the Dempster Highway area. Yukon has a one-man army charged with monitoring the huge mammoth ivory trade.
Mammoth ivory has been found in Europe, North America and Asia since the end of the last ice age. The wooly mammoth roamed across the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the ice age when parts of Alaska and the Yukon in Canada were free of ice. Canada Fossils acquires mammoth ivory and tusks from these areas. Any tusks that can be restored are brought back to their original form.
The woolly mammoth first evolved in Eurasia and entered Alaska from Siberia over the Bering Land Bridge around 65,000 years ago. It dominated the grasslands of North America during periods of glaciation, but went extinct around 10
The Yukon government “encourages” placer miners to donate the mammoth ivory they find for the sake of science. That way, the government can get the first look at fossils to determine which ones should be archived and which should be sold. The only enforcement the government uses is Zazula.
