Decorative Joints. Different joints in concrete slabs all have the same bottom-line purpose of preventing cracks. As concrete moves, if it is tied to another structure or even to itself, we get what's called restraint, which causes tensile forces and invariably leads to cracking.

It can shrink about 1/16th of an inch for every ten feet of length. This shrinkage creates tension within the concrete that tries to tear it apart. Professionals who install concrete driveways install crisp tooled lines in the slabs. These are called control joints.
1 For an unreinforced slab, control joints should be spaced in feet 2 to 3 times the slab thickness in inches. 2  In other words, for a 4-inch slab, space the joints 8 to 12 feet apart. 3  The spacing is highly dependent on the concrete mix's shrinkage potential.
What a contraction joint really is in the end is a crack in the slab that we force to follow a line of our own choosing. We create a weakened line across the slab and let nature take its course. When the slab does crack, that's called joint activation.. Here are a few things to consider about contraction joints:
At this load, plastic hinge forms all along the supports. They are called yield lines: Step 2 For λ in excess of 0.9375, there is effectively a hinge all along the length of the support at each side. The BMD is found by adding that from Step 1 plus the extra BMD induced by the increase in load.
