Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial infection resistant to antibiotic methicillin. Staphylococcus aureus, sometimes referred to simply as staph, or staph A is a common bacterium found on the skin of healthy people. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus produces symptoms no different from any other type of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The skin will appear red, swollen, and inflamed around wound sites.
Standard Precautions. These standard precautions should control the spread of MRSA in most instances. 1  Hand Hygiene Perform hand hygiene after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn. 1 To assist with decision making about patient placement in various types of healthcare facilities see page 84 of Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 PDF (3.80 MB / 225 pages).
Stopping the spread of MRSA is in your hands!6 What if it is a serious staph infection? These infections are treated with penicillin or penicillin type antibiotics.Antibiotics such as Methicillin, Amoxicillin, and Penicillin can be effective in treating staph infections. Stopping the spread of MRSA is in your hands!12 I know patients are concerned if they are told they have a Staph infection. Physicians will determine the type of infection and if the infection will respond to the Penicillin family of
About the organism. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterial infection that is highly resistant to certain antibiotics called beta-lactams. These antibiotics include methicillin and other more common antibiotics such as oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. Populations that are more susceptible to MRSA colonization, include intravenous drug users, persons with dermatological diseases, or diabetes, and persons on renal dialysis. If you see the Epic MRSA FYI alert screen in a patient's chart, please make sure the patient is on Contact Precautions.
Transmission-Based Precautions. There are three types of transmission-based precautions: contact precautions (for diseases spread by direct or indirect contact), droplet precautions (for diseases spread by large particles in the air), and airborne precautions (for diseases spread by small particles in the air). 
1 When cohorting patients with the same MRSA is not possible, place MRSA patients in rooms with patients who are at low risk for acquisition of MRSA and associated adverse outcomes from infection and are likely to have short lengths of stay. 1 To assist with decision making about patient placement in various types of healthcare facilities see page 84 of Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 PDF (3.80 MB / 225 pages).
Staphylococcus (STAFF-ih-low-KOCK-us) aureus (ARE-ee-us) is a type of bacteria, or germ. These bacteria are often called “staph.” Staph bacteria can live in the nose and on the skin. 1 in 5 people have these bacteria. In most cases, Staph bacteria cause no infection. But in some people, Staph can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, wound infections, and blood infections. Methicillin (meth-ih-SILL-in) is an antibiotic often used to treat Staph infections. When Staph is “methicillin resistant,” most antibiotics cannot kill the bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria are called “MRSA” for short
Anibioics are given to kill Staph germs when they cause infecions. Some Staph are resistant, meaning they cannot be killed by some anibioics. “Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus” or “MRSA” is a type of Staph that is resistant to some of the anibioics that are oten used to treat Staph infecions. What can I do to help prevent MRSA. In the hospital. •. Make sure that all doctors, nurses, and. other healthcare providers clean their. hands with soap and water or an alcohol-. based hand rub before and ater caring for. you.
The following are recommended for prevention of VRE and MRSA in hospitals and may be adapted for use in non-hospital healthcare facilities: 1  Obtain stool cultures or rectal swab cultures of roommates of patients newly found to be infected or colonized with VRE, and nasal swabs for MRSA. 1 To assist with decision making about patient placement in various types of healthcare facilities see page 84 of Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 PDF (3.80 MB / 225 pages).
