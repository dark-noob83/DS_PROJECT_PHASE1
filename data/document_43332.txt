Lactase is an enzyme produced by many organisms. It is located in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals. Lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk; it breaks down lactose, a sugar which gives milk its sweetness. The optimum temperature for human lactase is about 37°C for its activity and has an optimum pH of 6. In metabolism, the β -glycosidic bond in D-lactose is hydrolyzed to form D-galactose and D-glucose, which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream.
Summary. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family 1 of glycosyl hydrolases. The protein is integral to plasma membrane and has both phlorizin hydrolase activity and lactase activity. 1 The findings of this study suggest that at least the ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms of the VDR gene and T-13910C of the LCT gene are associated with the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis in our sample of the Belarusian women.
1 T/G 13915 variant upstream of the lactase gene (LCT) is the founder allele of lactase persistence in an urban Saudi population. 2  These data show that the T(-13910) variant is found on two different, highly divergent haplotype backgrounds in the global populations. 1 The findings of this study suggest that at least the ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms of the VDR gene and T-13910C of the LCT gene are associated with the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis in our sample of the Belarusian women.
lactose intolerance-caused by mutations in the LCT gene. At least nine LCT gene mutations cause congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia. In this disorder, infants are unable to break down lactose (lactose intolerance) in breast milk or formula. Molecular Location on chromosome 2: base pairs 135,787,844 to 135,837,179. The LCT gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 21. More precisely, the LCT gene is located from base pair 135,787,844 to base pair 135,837,179 on chromosome 2.
Entrez Gene Summary for LCT Gene. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the family 1 of glycosyl hydrolases. The protein is integral to plasma membrane and has both phlorizin hydrolase activity and lactase activity. GeneCards Summary for LCT Gene. LCT (Lactase) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with LCT include lactase deficiency, congenital and lactose intolerance.
Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a 4170T-A transversion in the LCT gene, resulting in a tyr1390-to-ter (Y1390X) substitution. The other patients were compound heterozygotes for this mutation, designated Fin(major), and 1 of 4 rare mutations (see. e.g., 603202.0002 - 603202.0003). (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the LCT gene: the Fin(major) mutation (603020.0001) and a 4-bp deletion, 4998-5001delTGAG, resulting in a frameshift at serine-1666 and premature termination at codon 1722.
In addition, the lactase gene has a higher expression when T−13910 and A−22018 are present and a lower expression when C−13910 and G−22018 are present. The position -13910 has an enhancer function on the lactase promoter (the promoter facilitates the transcription of the LCT gene). Lactase-persistent alleles vary in their geographic distributions. Within European and descendent populations, they are almost entirely correlated with the presence of the -13,910 C/T mutation of the lactase gene (LCT).
The gene for lactase is known as LCT, and it is mostly expressed in cells in the epithelium of the small intestine. Although nearly everyone can produce the enzyme at birth, the majority of people outside Northern Europe lose the ability to produce a lot of it at some point during the first years of life. 
The LCT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme helps to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactase is produced by cells that line the walls of the small intestine. Molecular Location on chromosome 2: base pairs 135,787,844 to 135,837,179. The LCT gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 21. More precisely, the LCT gene is located from base pair 135,787,844 to base pair 135,837,179 on chromosome 2.
