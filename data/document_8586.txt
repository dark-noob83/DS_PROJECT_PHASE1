In a household circuit, the frequency is 60 Hz. The angular frequency is related to the frequency, f, by: Vo represents the maximum voltage, which in a household circuit in North America is about 170 volts. We talk of a household voltage of 120 volts, though; this number is a kind of average value of the voltage. 
It is commonly measured in units of Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 s –1. For example, the second hand on a clock completes one revolution every 60 seconds and therefore has an angular frequency of 1 /60 Hz. You’ve encountered frequency and period when dealing with springs and simple harmonic motion, and you will encounter them again in the chapter on waves. These terms are also relevant to rotational motion, and SAT II Physics has been known to test the relation between angular velocity and angular frequency and period.
Then, if the magnitude of the angular velocity is increasing, the angular acceleration is in the same direction as the angular velocity vector. On the other hand, if the magnitude of the angular velocity is decreasing, then the angular acceleration points in the direction opposite the angular velocity vector. You’ve encountered frequency and period when dealing with springs and simple harmonic motion, and you will encounter them again in the chapter on waves. These terms are also relevant to rotational motion, and SAT II Physics has been known to test the relation between angular velocity and angular frequency and period.
Angular frequency. In physics, angular frequency ω is a scalar measure of rotation rate. Angular frequency is the magnitude of the vector quantity angular velocity. The term angular frequency vector is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity. One revolution is equal to 2π radians, hence where. 
Angular velocity and angular acceleration are vector quantities; the equations above define their magnitudes but not their directions. Given that objects with angular velocity or acceleration are moving in a circle, how do we determine the direction of the vector? You’ve encountered frequency and period when dealing with springs and simple harmonic motion, and you will encounter them again in the chapter on waves. These terms are also relevant to rotational motion, and SAT II Physics has been known to test the relation between angular velocity and angular frequency and period.
In physics, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational analog of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity – the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque. Angular momentum is related to the rotation or revolution of matter. It is, in effect, a measure of the quantity of rotation of a system of matter, taking into account its mass, rotations, motions and shape. The conservation of angular momentum explains many observed phenomena
Angular Frequency. The angular frequency is often denoted by. The angular frequency is a constant of the motion. The angular frequency is most known in the simple harmonic motion equation (shm). 
+50. Well, the key difference here is that one is a vector quantity while the other is a scalar. If your angle is measured in radians then angular frequency $\omega$ is given by. $$ \omega = 2 \pi f \space \mbox{(rad)} s^{-1} $$. while angular velocity is. $$ \vec{\Omega} = \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} \mbox{m} \space s^{-1} $$. What you have above is the magnitude of the angular velocity (which I am assuming is expressed in radians). $$ \vert \omega \vert = \frac{d \theta}{dt} \mbox{rad} \space s^{-1} $$. Often people leave out the radian, since it's just a number. The radian is engineering-dimensionless.
