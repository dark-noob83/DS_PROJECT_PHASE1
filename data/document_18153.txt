Farther is primarily an adverb. Further too is an adverb; but it is also used as an adjective. Both mean the same when used to refer to the concept of distance. However, there are some shades of difference in the meaning of these words and it is this that makes the speaker of English confused about the words. The words ‘farther’ and ‘further’ are two words in every day usage and it is very easy to get confused.
Further vs Farther. ‘Further and ‘farther’ are two similar sounding words that have similar connotations of usage too. The difference in a first glance is only with respect to the second letter of the two words, and they are used almost interchangeably in the daily parlance.
You should know the difference between “farther” and “further”. Many people use “further” and “farther” interchangeable, but, in fact, they mean slightly different things. “Farther” refers to a physical distance, while “further” refers to a figurative distance.
Probably the best way to remember the distinction between “farther” and “further” is to think about where you’d use the word “furthermore”. In this case, you use it much like “in addition to”, which is tied to something figurative. So just remember “farther” = “physical” and “further” = “figurative”.
Farther is used in relation to physical distance; it means at or to a greater distance whereas further means to a greater degree. An easy way to remember is to use the mnemonic In a galaxy far, farther away.., which will remind you to use farther only in the context of distance.
