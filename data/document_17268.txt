The structure of DNA lends itself easily to DNA replication. Each side of the double helix runs in opposite (anti-parallel) directions. The beauty of this structure is that it can unzip down the middle and each side can serve as a pattern or template for the other side (called semi-conservative replication).
DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. 1  The first step in DNA replication is to ‘unzip’ the double helix structure of the DNA molecule.
Cells need to copy their DNA when they divide. This process is called DNA replication. To understand how DNA is copied, we first need to understand the structure of DNA. DNA is made of two long strands that wrap around each other to make the famous double helix.
1 A molecule of a DNA polymerase binds to one strand of the DNA and begins moving along it in the 3' to 5' direction, using it as a template for assembling a leading strand of nucleotides and reforming a double helix. 2  In eukaryotes, this molecule is called DNA polymerase epsilon (ε).
The process in which DNA duplicates itself is called DNA  replication. This process is an important factor in biological  inheritance.
Before a cell divides, its DNA is replicated (duplicated.) Because the two strands of a DNA molecule have complementary base pairs, the nucleotide sequence of each strand automatically supplies the information needed to produce its partner.
DNA is duplicated though a process called DNA replication. It is a process which involves many enzymes (proteins with specific functions) interacting with the parent DNA str … and and creating a copy of it. DNA replication is called semi conservative because in the newly formed DNA, one strand belongs to the parent strand and the other one is synthesized newly.
The DNA replication process is a procedure wherein the DNA double helix splits and duplicates itself to make copies of the strands of DNA. Read on to know more about DNA replication, and the process involved...
