Until recently, crowned lemurs were thought to be a sub-species of the mongoose lemur. The crowned lemur is a mostly diurnal lemur with a very limited range in the northern tip of Madagascar. This lemur weighs, on average, about 1700 grams 1.7 kg. (3.4 lbs.), making it the smallest member of the Eulemur genus.
Distribution and Habitat. Ring-tailed lemurs are found in the southwest portion of Madagascar. They live in arid, open areas and forests. Ring-tailed lemurs live in territories that range from 15 to 57 acres (0.06 to 0.2 km 2) in size.
Ring-tailed lemur habitat. The ring-tailed lemur is found in a broader range of habitats than any other lemur species, and can tolerate a variety of extreme environments that other lemurs cannot, including some of the hottest, driest and coldest in Madagascar.
The average day range of ring-tailed lemurs is about 1000 m (.621 mi) and one group will use the same part of its home range for three or four days before moving to another part. The home range size varies, depending on habitat, and average size ranges from.1 to.35 km² (.039 to.135 mi²) (Sussman 2000).
Ring-tailed lemurs can be found in the dry woodlands of southwestern Madagascar. They live together in social groups of up to about 25 lemurs and are very territorial. A group s range can be as small as around 15 acres and as large as 60. Ring-tailed lemurs mark their territory with scents produced in glands in their wrists.
