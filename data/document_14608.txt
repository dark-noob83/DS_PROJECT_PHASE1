If it takes 75 units of Botox® to weaken forehead muscles, you could expect to pay $750 to $1,125 for it. The cost of Botox® depends upon how many units are injected, the technique of injection, and geography. Beware of providers who want to charge you by the CC or syringe.
The average cost for a round of Botox® is about $500, but the specifics will obviously vary a lot from patient to patient. Some patients pay as little as $200 and some pay upwards of $900. This gap in the price range depends on lots of factors such as:
Some doctors charge based on the number of units of Botox injected and, therefore, have a price per unit of Botox. Botox vials come in two different sizes: 50-unit vials and 100-unit vials. The number of units injected depends on the number of wrinkles that want to be alleviated.
Typically, the vertical lines between the brows are injected with 13-30 units of Botox while the horizontal forehead lines need 10-20 units, the crow’s feet need 8-20 on each side and the bunny lines need 5-10 units. Botox is a revolutionary drug, and is so effective that it can reduce even deep wrinkles.
Botox Injection. I am 31 and just had botox for the first time. I had 10 units of botox 5 days ago for my 11 lines between my eyebrows. I feel that my lines were very deep, as I apparently scowl a lot. I do notice a difference, however my scowl lines are still very prominent.
Most women need 20-25 units for the treatment of frown lines. However, men may need 35 units because the bulk of muscle to be weakened is larger. Botox® prices nationwide average between $10 and $15 per unit.
