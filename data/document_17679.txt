You can find out which interface is used in the EtherChannel to forward traffic based on the load balancing method. The command for this determination is test etherchannel load-balance interface port-channel number {ip | mac} [source_ip_add | source_mac_add] [dest_ip_add | dest_mac_add] . When you enable UplinkFast, the EtherChannel port path cost, which you set with the set channel cost command, for a 4-port 10/100 EtherChannel is less than the port path cost of a parallel Gigabit Ethernet link. This situation causes the slower 4-port EtherChannel to forward and the Gigabit Ethernet link to block.
In this tutorial we‟ll take a look at etherchannel which is also known as link aggregation. Etherchannel is a technology that lets you bundle multiple physical links into a single logical link. We”ll take a look at how it works and what the advantages of etherchannel are. Let’s start with an example of a small network: Take a look at the picture above.
EtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology or port-channel architecture used primarily on Cisco switches. It allows grouping of several physical Ethernet links to create one logical Ethernet link for the purpose of providing fault-tolerance and high-speed links between switches, routers and servers. When an EtherChannel is configured all adapters that are part of the channel share the same Layer 2 (MAC) address. This makes the EtherChannel transparent to network applications and users because they only see the one logical connection; they have no knowledge of the individual links.
Dear All, What is the different if I use etherchannel mode ON in Cisco Switch between two switches, and if I use etherchannel with 2 negotiation protocol (LACP/PagP) between two switches?
EtherChannel is primarily used in the backbone network, but can also be used to connect end user machines. EtherChannel technology was invented by Kalpana in the early 1990s. They were later acquired by Cisco Systems in 1994. When an EtherChannel is configured all adapters that are part of the channel share the same Layer 2 (MAC) address. This makes the EtherChannel transparent to network applications and users because they only see the one logical connection; they have no knowledge of the individual links.
EtherChannel reduces part of the binary pattern that is formed from the addresses in the frame to a numerical value that selects one of the links in the channel in order to balance the traffic load across the links in a channel. When you enable UplinkFast, the EtherChannel port path cost, which you set with the set channel cost command, for a 4-port 10/100 EtherChannel is less than the port path cost of a parallel Gigabit Ethernet link. This situation causes the slower 4-port EtherChannel to forward and the Gigabit Ethernet link to block.
EtherChannel technology can be used to increase the bandwidth between two devices that support EtherChannel technology and EtherChannel technology provides automatic recovery for the loss of a link by redistributing the load across the remaining links. The main advantages of EtherChannel technology is that it allows load sharing of traffic among the links in the channel as well as redundancy in the event that one or more links in the EtherChannel fail. EtherChannel is a Cisco Copyrighted term and the term which industry adopted is Link Aggregation. There are two protocols used for negotiating EtherChannel and Link Aggregation. We can configure Etherchannel in three ways in Cisco Switches. 1  Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) - Cisco Proprietary protocol
My Cisco. EtherChannel provides incremental trunk speeds between Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. EtherChannel combines multiple Fast Ethernet up to 800Mbps, Gigabit Ethernet up to 8Gbps, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet up to 80Gbps.
