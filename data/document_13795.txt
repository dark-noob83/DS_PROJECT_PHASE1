By pruning, you can give your little gem magnolia the shape you want, as a screen for your landscape or as a tree. Once you have determined the shape and how you want your magnolia tree to grow, you can prune it as needed.
Overview. The Little Gem Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora 'Little Gem') is a variety of the Southern Magnolia that is smaller and more compact. It has an upright shrubby form, rather than a tree form. It grows 20 to 30 feet tall and 10 feet wide.
2. Use hedge shears to prune your little gem magnolia into a hedge shape. Cut off the branches at their ends to shape as needed. You can also cut it more closely on one side as an espalier or to grow flat against a wall. When pruned in this manner, the magnolia will sprout new growth to fill in more thickly.
Little Gem magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora Little Gem), a compact evergreen tree, is a slow-grower but can sport flowers when it's only 2 to 3 years old. Also known as the dwarf Southern magnolia, this tree works well for smaller yards and in lawns, near decks and patios, in planters or as a privacy screen or hedge.
How to Prune Little Gem Magnolia Trees. Little Gem blooms white and can be deciduous at the cooler end of its range. Southern magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) are grand trees in full bloom, but mature specimens top out at 60 to 80 feet tall, and can overwhelm a small yard.
Tips and Warnings. 1  If a Little Gem Magnolia needs major pruning, or the area that needs pruning is extremely high, contact a certified arborist for assistance. 2  Consult the local Yellow Pages or call your local county extension office for contact information for certified arborists.
