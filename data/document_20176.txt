Blue Nile. bluenile.com. WARNING, although we've heard WONDERFUL things about Blue Nile and once thought of purchasing their stock, my husband tried to buy me an anniversary ring from them. He thought all was fine until he received a phone call from their customer service saying the diamond he picked is not available. BiG DEAL! I am looking at a ring that is $25, 000 and I don't even expect anything from Blue Nile other than to call me and let me know, too, if the ring is not available. That is what I called customer service.
