Diet for chronic pancreatitis is a number one strategy recommended for patients diagnosed with inflamed pancreas. Inflammation in the pancreas causes narrowing of the bilary ducts or sometimes even their complete obstruction.
2. Lean cuts of meat, preferably filets of chicken, turkey, rabbit and veal, are low in fat and high in proteins, iron, zinc and essential amino acids to maintain good health. Diet for chronic pancreatitis needs to include only steaming or poaching methods of meat cooking, absolutely no frying or grilling.
-Yogurt. Probiotics are crucial in a pancreatitis diet. These live bacteria in yogurt help keep the balance of your digestive system, as well as help to maintain your bodyâ€™s immunity level, which prevents inflammation.
You should eat small portions and often, so as not to elevate your symptoms. Products to be avoided in the Pancreatitis diet include caffeine, tobacco, spicy foods, eggs, butter, cheese, fried foods, bacon, pizza, beer, beans, and other general gas-forming foods, which could cause inflammation of the pancreas.
Spinach is a good source of iron and vitamin B, both of which your pancreas needs. Try a spinach salad, or spinach stir-fried with garlic. Other leafy greens, like kale, mustard and Swiss chard are also beneficial for your pancreas.
1. Avoid foods with high fat content. One of the causes of pancreatitis are high triglycerides (fats) in the blood. A diet high in fat is sure to bring on pancreatitis attacks so it is best to avoid meats, dairy and fried foods. Eat more carbohydrates, legumes, and fish.
The pancreas produces insulin, which reduces blood sugar levels and allows your body to store food energy for future use. Eating the right foods can heal and nourish your pancreas. It may also help you avoid pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas.
