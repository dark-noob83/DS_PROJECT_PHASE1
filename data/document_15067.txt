Whole Kernel Corn. Quantity: An average of 31½ pounds (in husk) of sweet corn is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 20 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints. A bushel weighs 35 pounds and yields 6 to 11 quarts which is an average of 4½ pounds per quart. Quantity: An average of 31½ pounds (in pods) is needed per canner load of 7 quarts; an average of 20 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.

A bushel (abbreviation: bsh. or bu. ) is an imperial and US customary unit of weight or mass based upon an earlier measure of dry capacity. The old bushel was equal to 4 pecks or 8 gallons and was used mostly for agricultural products such as wheat. This is the bushel in some use in the United Kingdom. The Winchester bushel was the volume of a cylinder 18.5 in (46.99 cm) in diameter and 8 in (20.32 cm) high, which gives an irrational number of cubic inches.

Answer by Johnnyboy123. Confidence votes 152. A bushel of shelled corn weighs 56 pounds (25.401 kilograms). A bushel actually used to be a volumetric measurement but due to inconsistency in volumes between crops like corn, wheat or soybeans, it was changed to 60 lbs, then 56 lbs. Somewhere between 50 and 100 pounds. Yeah, that sounds like a pretty big variance, and it is. Actually, a bushel of apples weigh's in at about 42 lbs. This is depending on the apple variety, i.e. smaller apples will weigh more per bushel volume and some apples are act … ually more dense, etc. but 42 lbs per bushel is about average.     Take Care!
ExampleHow many pounds of 20.5 percent moisture wheat is equivalent to a standard bushel? 13.5 percent Standard Moisture Content = 100 - 13.5 = 86.5 percent Dry Matter 20.5 percent Moisture Content = 100 - 20.5 = 79.5 percent Dry Matter 86.5 ÷ 79.5 = 108.8 percent (108.8 x Standard Bu. Use percent dry matter in making conversions because the problem is to obtain the same weight of dry matter as is found in a standard bushel. For example, a standard bushel of wheat contains 60 pounds at 13.5 percent moisture. Thus, 86.5 percent dry matter (100-13.5) x 60 pounds = 51.9 pounds of dry matter.
