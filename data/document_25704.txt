@Atzenkiller: hu lets see.. A ps4 with a game costs $400. Without the game your ps4 is worth(new) $340 Since its used you will sell it for about $300 online. Now subtract the shipping costs and online fees you get about $250. So yea not far from $200. Gamestop offered me $15 trade in for a game that still sells brand new for $60, and they sell used for $55. What a joke. Even more of a joke are people who would pay $55 for a used game when an extra $5 gets you a brand new copy, and supports the developers.

While it is true that Gamestop will only offer no more than $20 for the topic creator's Wii (so $17.50 is about right), he can sell the Wii by itself (maybe throw in Wii Sports resort and an extra controller with Nunchuck) for a MINIMUM of $50 on ebay or Amazon. Seriously, that's all they will give you. As for the games, the games on your list will only be worth $1 - $3 each at Gamestop. Seriously, Gamestop will only give you $1 - $3 each for your games.

It depends on how much they can sell the game for, seriously. Gamestop prefers to have a considerably markup on used games, and so they only pay a small fraction for the game compared to what they sell it for. (They justify it saying that it is required to support the amount of overhead needed to buy/sell used games and manange inventory for different stores/districts). If you call your local store, they will look it up and tell you. You may get more if you sell it on Ebay or something. Remember Gamestop also has to make a profit, so you may not get much for it. Or you can hold out for trade in deals they have.
