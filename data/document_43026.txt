The medical care costs of obesity in the United States are high. In 2008 dollars, these costs were estimated to be $147 billion. 15. The annual nationwide productive costs of obesity obesity-related absenteeism range between $3.38 billion ($79 per obese individual) and $6.38 billion ($132 per obese individual) 16.

For Medicare, the costs of obesity are about 72 percent greater just for prescription drugs, Finkelstein said. An obese person on Medicare is going to pay $1,400 in drug costs more a year than a normal-weight person, he said. For people on Medicare, average expenses for a normal-weight person average about $4,700 a year, while costs for an obese person range about $6,400 annually, Finkelstein said. The biggest driver of these excess costs are

1 $62 billion -- Medicare and Medicaid are spending nearly this amount every year on obesity-related costs. 2  $66 billion -- Columbia University researchers say that if current trends don't change, annul obesity-related medical costs in the U.S. could increase this amount by 2030. 1 $190 billion -- That's the amount of added medical costs every year that are estimated to stem from obesity-related problems. 2  It’s nearly 21% of total U.S. health care costs.
A normal-weight individual will spend about $3,400 per year in medical expenditures and that number rises to about $4,870 if that individual is obese, study author Eric Finkelstein, director, RTI Public Health Economics Program in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said during the press conference. For people on Medicare, average expenses for a normal-weight person average about $4,700 a year, while costs for an obese person range about $6,400 annually, Finkelstein said. The biggest driver of these excess costs are prescription drugs
U.S Healthcare is spending twice as much on obesity than previously believed, reports a new Cornwell University study. Obesity now accounts for almost 21% of the US health care costs. The research is first of its kind to show the causal effect of obesity on medical care costs. It is estimated that about one third of U.S adults are obese. In a separate study, researchers found that the average yearly health costs were $1,275 more for smokers than non-smokers and $ 1,850 more for obese people than those with normal weight.
At current rate of increase, the obesity rate in America in 2030 would be about 50 percent, which could cause over 6 million cases of diabetes, 5 million cases of coronary heart disease, and half a million cases of cancer by 2030 (Levi). In 2010, 36 states had an obesity rate of at least 25 percent, and 12 states had an obesity rate of 30 percent or higher (Pomerance). This dramatic rise in obesity has caused many problems for the economy and healthcare system.
If Americans continue to pack on pounds, obesity will cost the USA about $344 billion in medical-related expenses by 2018, eating up about 21% of health-care spending, says the first analysis to estimate the future medical costs of excess weight. 
-Researchers estimate that if obesity trends continue, obesity related medical costs, alone, could rise by $43 to $66 billion each year in the United States by 2030. -Per capita medical spending is $2,741 higher for people with obesity than for normal weight individuals. - Annual health costs related to obesity in the U.S. is nearly $200 billion, and nearly 21 percent of medical costs in the U.S. can be attributed to obesity.
