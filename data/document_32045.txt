Determine how many square feet a bag of insulation will cover and calculate cost by dividing the square feet in the attic by the square feet a bag or material will cover. If a bag will cover 100 square feet and the attic is 1,200 square feet, it would take 12 bags; if a bag costs $30, that would total $360. Measure the attic with a tape measure to determine how many square feet (length times width in feet) will need to be insulated. Most general estimates put the cost for an average home at $1,800 to $2,400, but that will vary widely with the amount of insulation needed and the size of the attic.
