An average of 2000 steps is a mile, and 8 standard city blocks is 1 mile. Saturday, March 18, 2006, 9:20 AM. re: Steps in a Mile There are roughly 2,000 steps in a mile, although it varies on how tall you are because of your stride. So if you walk 10,000 steps in a day, you are walking about 5 miles. On average, Americans walk about 2,000-2,500 steps in a day. For me, I happen to know that my normal stride is approximately 2.5 feet, just under a yard. This works out to 2112 steps in a mile (5280 feet), or 4.73 miles in 10000 steps. I am 5'8.
According to the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services, there are 2,000 to 2,500 steps to a mile. The number of steps will vary with individual walking patterns. When people walk, the distance between the heel of one shoe as it strikes the ground to the next shoeâ€™s end of the toe will be different. This difference in step lengths accumulates over distance, resulting in a difference of about 500 steps to a mile. The best way is to count the number of steps you need to walk a known distance, such as a football field, which is 300 feet. Divide the number of steps you need to cover the 300 feet. For 100 steps, the step length would be three feet
Figure 1,900-2,600 steps per mile depending on your stride length. Stride length is dependent on (1) your leg length, and (2) how fast you're moving. It's longer when you jog or run, compared with walking, which means your step count will be different for the same distance depending on your mode of activity. 
Using a pedometer or step counter can help you track the number of steps you take each day. Then you can set goals to take more steps and be more active. 1  Using a pedometer or step counter is an easy and fun way to track how active you are. 2  It adds up all the steps you take during the day. 3  Using a pedometer can remind you to walk more. 4  A quick check may show that you need more steps for the day.
Take several measurements and average them. The best way is to count the number of steps you need to walk a known distance, such as a football field, which is 300 feet. Divide the number of steps you need to cover the 300 feet. For 100 steps, the step length would be three feet
The average person walks between 3,000 and 4,000 steps per day. To find out how many steps you take each day, buy a pedometer similar to the one in the video at the bottom of this page. Clip it firmly to your belt or waistband, and it will measure every step you take: around the house, across the office, window shopping, to school or the park.
