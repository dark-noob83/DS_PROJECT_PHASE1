The three-year survival rate was approximately 79.3% for males and 77.2% for the females. They concluded in their statistics that the five-year survival showed 67.4% for females and was 73.1% for males. Statistics have shown that life expectancy at 10 years after transplant is 49%. Statistics Of Life Expectancy. Life expectancy after a heart transplant is 85%, the first year. About 95% of the patients who had the transplant, have a significant improvement in their quality of life too. The first historical heart transplant surgery to be performed in the United States was in January 1969
“We studied survival rates beyond 15 years for pediatric heart transplant patients to learn more about quality of life and factors that led to improved survival.”. More than half (54.3% or 183/337) of the pediatric transplant patients in the study group survived at least 15 years past surgery. 
Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier estimate, correlation coefficients, and general linear regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Survival rates 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation were 87%, 77%, and 57%, respectively, and the average life expectancy was 9.16 years. The mental QOL of patients 10 years after heart transplantation was similar to that among the general population. 
Survival rates for people receiving heart transplants have improved, especially in the first year after the transplant. About 88 percent of patients survive the first year after transplant surgery, and 75 percent survive for 5 years. The 10-year survival rate is about 56 percent.
HCM patients account for about 1% of all heart transplants performed nationwide. One year after transplant, the survival rate was 85% for patients in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy group and 82% for those with other heart diseases. The survival rates were 75% and 70%, respectively, after five years, and 61% and 49%, respectively, after 10 years. 
OUTCOME AFTER FIRST HEART TRANSPLANT. Survival — Approximately 85 to 90 percent of heart transplant patients are living one year after their surgery, with an annual death rate of approximately 4 percent thereafter. The three-year survival approaches 75 percent. (See Prognosis after cardiac transplantation .). 
In carefully selected people, a heart transplant can be very successful. About 87 out of 100 people who have a heart transplant survive for at least 1 year. About 50 out of 100 survive 10 years. Most people can have a good quality of life after their transplant. 
About 79% of all people who receive heart transplants survive for at least 1 year, while 75% survive 5 years and 60% survive 10 years. Recognize these statistics address a majority of older recipients who often have other maladies to complicate the factors. Statistics for younger patients is much better. Most statistics only give the survival rates for up to 5 years after transplant (71.2% for males, 69.9%) for females.
The 10-year survival rate is close to 50 percent, and 16 percent of heart transplant patients survive 20 years. After the surgery, most heart transplant recipients (about 90 percent) can come close to resuming their normal daily activities. However, fewer than 40 percent return to work for many different reasons. When the immune system-the body's defense system-is suppressed, the patient is at increased risk for infection. Infection is a major cause of hospital admission for heart transplant patients and a leading cause of death in the first year after transplant.
