As population density increases, birth rate often decreases and death rate typically increases. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the natural increase. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase, or could require a negative natural increase.
Santurce is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean, east of Old San Juan and west of Isla Verde. The district occupies an area of 5.24 square miles (13.6 km 2) of land and 3.46 (8.96 km2) of water.

Thus, the carrying capacity is the number of individuals an environment can support without significant negative impacts to the given organism and its environment. Below carrying capacity, populations typically increase, while above, they typically decrease. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the natural increase. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase, or could require a negativ

The carrying capacity of an environment may vary for different species and may change over time due to a variety of factors, including: food availability, water supply, environmental conditions and living space. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate is the natural increase. The carrying capacity could support a positive natural increase, or could require a negativ
