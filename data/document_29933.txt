Gene knockout A gene knockout is a genetically engineered organism that carries one or more genes in itschromosomes that have been made inoperative (have been knocked out of the organism). This isdone for research purposes. (Gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only been possiblesince 2003.)UseKnocking out the activity of a gene provides information about what that gene normally does.Humans share many genes with mice.
A knockout mouse or knock-out mouse is a genetically modified mouse (Mus musculus) which researchers have inactivated, or knocked out, an existing gene by replacing it or disrupting it with an artificial piece of DNA. While knockout mouse technology represents a valuable research tool, some important limitations exist. About 15 percent of gene knockouts are developmentally lethal, which means that the genetically altered embryos cannot grow into adult mice.
The term also refers to the process of creating such an organism, as in knocking out a gene. The technique is essentially the opposite of a gene knockin. Knocking out two genes simultaneously in an organism is known as a double knockout (DKO). Similarly the terms triple knockout (TKO) and quadruple knockouts (QKO) are used to describe three or four knocked out genes, respectively.

This is done by introducing short sequences called loxP sites around the gene.
Disadvantages of knockout technology. Although knockout mice are extremely useful in studying gene function, producing custom knockout mice is very expensive. Typical cost ranges anywhere from $3,000 to as much as $30,000. There are hundreds of knockout mice commercially available. The technique has been used to make several thousand different knockout mice. Knockout mice have become one of the most useful scientific tools in helping to understand the human genome and its roles in disease. The process of gene targeting involves two processes.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A gene knockout (abbreviation: KO) is a genetic technique in which one of an organism 's genes is made inoperative (knocked out of the organism). A knockout mouse (left) that is a model of obesity, compared with a normal mouse. A conditional knockout allows gene deletion in a tissue or time specific manner. This is done by introducing short sequences called loxP sites around the gene.
Gene knockout is a technique for selectively inactivating a gene by replacing it with a mutant allele in an otherwise normal organism. This technique of disrupting gene function, which has been widely used in yeast and mice, is a powerful tool for unraveling the mechanisms by which basic cellular processes occur. ES cells containing a knockout mutation in one allele of the gene being studied are introduced into early mouse embryos. The resultant mice will be chimeras containing tissues derived from both the transplanted ES cells and the host cells. These cells can contribute to both the germ-cell and somatic-cell populations.
Still, only some of the cells that make up the chimeric mouse carry the knockout mutation, and those cells are heterozygous for the mutation. In order to learn about the function of the target gene, a mouse that is homozygous for the knockout mutation must be studied. To produce a mouse that is homozygous for the target gene knockout, chimeric mice capable of passing the knockout mutation on to their offspring must be identified. Figure 6: Mating a chimeric (spotted) mouse with a normal (white) mouse can yield a knockout mouse, among other normal mice.

The loss of gene activity often causes changes in a mouse's phenotype, which includes appearance, behavior and other observable physical and biochemical characteristics. Knockout mice are important animal models for studying the role of genes which have been sequenced but whose functions have not been determined. By causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse, and observing any differences from normal behaviour or physiology, researchers can infer its probable function. While knockout mouse technology represents a valuable research tool, some important limitations exist. About 15 percent of gene knockouts are developmentally lethal, which means that the genetically altered embryos cannot grow into adult mice.
The gene knockout is created by selectively disabling a specific target gene in a particular type of cells called embryonic stem cells. The three scientists received the Lasker Award in 2001 for this achievement. The technique has been used to make several thousand different knockout mice. Knockout mice have become one of the most useful scientific tools in helping to understand the human genome and its roles in disease. The process of gene targeting involves two processes.
