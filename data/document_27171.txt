Confidence votes 23.6K. Mallard ducks have been clocked at 50 - 60 mph. Ordinary flight is around 40-55 mph for most ducks. (Add an additional 10-12 mph when chased.) Canvasbacks, when chased, have reached 72 mph. The red-breasted merganser is the fastest duck ever recorded, attaining a top airspeed of 100 mph while being pursued by an airplane. A Grumman G-73 Turbo-Mallard cruises at about 18
It’s the smallest dabbling duck. The wingspan of this bird can reach 53–59 cm (21–23 in). This bird can fly at the top speed of 109 km/hour (68 mph). Common Teals are highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and will form large flocks. They are 48-56 cm (19-22 in) in length with 79-89 cm (31-35 in) wingspan. This bird can fly at the speed of 116 km/hour (72 mph). They are migrating through the Mississippi flyway during winter to the south. The male and female of this duck can be recognized with its head color.
Canvasback duck: 72 mph. The Canvasback duck (AythyaValisineria) is a large diving duck that live in North America. They are 48-56 cm (19-22 in) in length with 79-89 cm (31-35 in) wingspan. This bird can fly at the speed of 116 km/hour (72 mph). They are migrating through the Mississippi flyway during winter to the south. The male and female of this duck can be recognized with its head color.
During migration, geese can travel as fast as 70 miles per hour with a good tail wind at an altitude of up to 9,000 feet. Geese, like most of our migratory birds, often migrate during the night. Scientists are not positive how geese know their way along the migration route. 
They are strong migratory birds that can travel near the equator to south. They can fly at the speed of 105 km/hour (65 mph). They are large ducks with a wingspan of 23.6–28.2 cm (9.3–11.1 in). The male is usually larger than the female. They are 48-56 cm (19-22 in) in length with 79-89 cm (31-35 in) wingspan. This bird can fly at the speed of 116 km/hour (72 mph). They are migrating through the Mississippi flyway during winter to the south. The male and female of this duck can be recognized with its head color.
The prime reason why household ducks do not soar into the air is that their body mass is more than is necessary and it becomes fairly difficult for them to take it into the air. But on the whole, it is obvious that ducks can fly and may even take wing at a fast pace of about 50 miles per hour. They may repose after covering several miles but more often than not, they soar at a pace of nearly 5 miles per hour. Why Do Ducks Fly – Flying Ducks. Since ducks fall under the category of birds, so it is quite obvious that they will fly. Although there are many flightless birds too but one of the prime characteristics of birds is that they contain plumage which is largely used for flying.
How Fast and High Do Birds Fly? Generally birds follow the facetious advice often given to pilots -- fly low and slow.. Most cruise speeds are in the 20-to-30-mph range, with an eider duck having the fastest accurately clocked air speed of about 47 mph. A bird might be able to stay aloft 6 hours at 15 mph (maximum endurance, covering 90 miles) or 5 hours at 20 mph (maximum range, covering 100 miles). Birds can also choose to maximize speed, as when being chased by a predator or racing to defend a territory. Or they can choose some compromise between speed and range.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The fastest ducks can fly at an average of 33.962 kph but normal ducks can only fly at up to 15kph. Wild ducks are very capable of flying. Domesticated breeds are less able to fly as their body weight is much heavier, as they are selectively bred for meat. Even though some b … reeds of domesticated ducks can still fly.
