• Dominant allele is the stronger one from the two alleles and the weaker one is the recessive allele. • A dominant allele can express its phenotype in its both heterozygous and homozygous states, but the recessive allele expressed its phenotype only in its homozygous state or when dominant allele is absent. Recessive Allele. From the two alleles, the weaker one is known as recessive allele. This recessive allele is expressed only in the case of homozygous. In the case of heterozygous, the dominant allele masks the phenotype of
For an example, if we consider the dominant allele as (A) and recessive allele as (a), then in the case of homozygous, the two alleles can be written as AA, and it can be written as Aa, in the case of heterozygous. In both situations, the dominant allele can express its phenotype over recessive allele. Recessive Allele. From the two alleles, the weaker one is known as recessive allele. This recessive allele is expressed only in the case of homozygous. In the case of heterozygous, the dominant allele masks the phenotype of the
A dominant allele is an allele where its phenotype will always be represented when the allele for that gene is present. A recessive allele can be masked by a dominant allele when a dominant and recessive allele are present for the same gene. They are related to each other because whether they are dominant or recessive they are both homozygous, meaning the same. They can either be homozygous dominant or homozygous … recessive. If they are heterozygous then they are different because it contains one dominant and one recessive allele each.
The difference between a dominant allele and a recessive allele is that if a person inherits one dominant allele and one recessive allele the dominant allele will appear as it … is stronger or more dominant than a recessive allele the dominant allele is stronger the recessive allele weaker. A dominant allele is one which expresses what it codes for such as eye color no matter what the other allele is. A recessive allele will only express what it codes for if there is a recessive pair. All alleles come in pairs except on the XY chromosomes. For eye color Brown is dominant and blue is recessive so..
Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus. The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics. In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant to allele r, and allele r is recessive to allele R. This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention.
You will recall that genes have different forms called alleles. An allele can be recessive or dominant. A recessive allele only shows if the individual has two copies of the recessive allele. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of the allele to have blue eyes. A dominant allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of the allele. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of the allele to have brown eyes (and two copies will still give you brown eyes)

Different versions of a gene are called alleles. Alleles are described as either dominant or recessive depending on their associated traits. 1  Since human cells carry two copies of each chromosome they have two versions of each gene. 2  These different versions of a gene are called alleles. 3  Alleles can be either dominant or recessive. 
The different forms of a gene are called alleles. If both alleles are are identical, the organism is said to be homozygous for that trait. For instance, Mendel's purebred tall plants possessed two tall alleles and are said to be homozygous tall. When expressing dominant and recessive alleles, the dominant allele is always written as a capitalized letter, and the recessive allele as the same letter, but lower case.
