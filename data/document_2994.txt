24. Thyroid function tests are blood tests which help to check the function of the thyroid gland. They are mainly used to detect hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Note: the information below is a general guide only. Thyroid function tests are blood tests that check the levels of the hormones (chemicals) made by the thyroid gland. Some thyroid function tests also check the level of a hormone made by the pituitary gland in the brain, which acts on the thyroid gland.
The T4 test is known as the thyroxine test. The TSH test measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone in your blood. These are the two most common thyroid function tests and are usually ordered together. They are routinely performed on newborn babies to identify a low-functioning thyroid gland. Drawing Blood for Thyroid Function Tests. Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking and tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Certain medications and pregnancy may influence your test results. A blood draw, also known as venipuncture, is an outpatient procedure performed at a lab or a doctor’s office.
If your thyroid gland produces too many hormones, you may experience weight loss, high levels of anxiety, tremors, and a sense of being on a “high.” This is called “hyperthyroidism.”. Thyroid function tests are a series of blood tests used to measure how well your thyroid gland is working. Drawing Blood for Thyroid Function Tests.

A Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) blood test is combined with the Free T3 and Free T4 tests to provide the most accurate overview of thyroid function. Test also includes T3 Uptake, T4 and T7. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems, frequently ordered with the Thyroid Profile to measure levels and ratio of of T3 and T4.
Thyroid function tests (TFTs) is a collective term for blood tests used to check the function of the thyroid. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) is generally elevated in hypothyroidism and decreased in hyperthyroidism. It is the most sensitive test for thyroid hormone function.
Guide. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test is used to check for thyroid gland problems. TSH is produced when the hypothalamus releases a substance called thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH then triggers the pituitary gland to release TSH. 
TESTS. Blood tests to measure TSH, T4, T3 and Free T4 are readily available and widely used. Tests to evaluate thyroid function include the following: TSH TESTS The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism).
T3 tests, which check for levels of triiodothyronine, are usually ordered if T4 tests and TSH tests suggest hyperthyroidism. The T3 test may also be ordered if you are showing signs of an overactive thyroid gland. The normal range for the T3 is 100-200 nanograms of hormone per deciliter of blood.

The major thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland is thyroxine, also called T4 because it contains four iodine atoms. To exert its effects, T4 is converted to triiodothyronine (T3) by the removal of an iodine atom. Tests to evaluate thyroid function include the following: TSH TESTS The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism).
