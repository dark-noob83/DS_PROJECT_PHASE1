Th … e cerebrum is divided into two parts-the right hemisphere, which controls the left side of the body; and the left hemisphere, which controls the right side of the body. The cerebrum is just another name for the brain. The brain is made up of different sections that all have different functions. There are four main lobes, the frontal which is … in charge of decision making, talking, and voluntary movement.

There is also the parietal lobe which is the part of the brain that receives sensory input for touch and body position. The third lobe is called the temporal lobe which is mainly in charge of hearing. Then the fourth lobe is called the occipital lobe which is what helps us see everything.
The cerebrum is a large part of the brain containing the cerebral cortex (of the two cerebral hemispheres), as well as several subcortical structures, including the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. In humans, the cerebrum is the superior-most region of the central nervous system. Cerebral cortex [edit]. Surface of the cerebrum. The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of gray matter of the cerebrum, is found only in mammals. In larger mammals, including humans, the surface of the cerebral cortex folds to create gyri (ridges) and sulci (furrows) which increase the surface area.
The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. The forebrain consists of the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus (part of the limbic system). The midbrain consists of the tectum and tegmentum. The hindbrain is made of the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Often the midbrain, pons, and medulla are referred to together as the brainstem.
The cerebrum is the most superior and anterior of the brain’s major regions. It is the seat of reason, planning, memory, and sensory integration. All conscious thought originates in the cerebrum and can influence the subconscious functions of the lower regions of the brain. Anatomy. The cerebrum is a large, folded mass of nervous tissue that makes up the majority of the human brain. Many ridges of cerebral tissue, called gyri (singular: gyrus), extend from the surface of the cerebrum and are bordered by grooves in the cerebrum....
The cerebrum is another name for the cerebral cortex which is the part of the brain dedicated to higher activities such as complex movement (like speech), planning actio … ns, and processing vision. There is also the parietal lobe which is the part of the brain that receives sensory input for touch and body position. The third lobe is called the temporal lobe which is mainly in charge of hearing. Then the fourth lobe is called the occipital lobe which is what helps us see everything.
Location: Directionally, the cerebrum and the cortex that covers it is the uppermost part of the brain. It is the anterior portion of the forebrain and is superior to other brain structures such as the pons, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Images: 1  Cerebrum Images. By Regina Bailey. Cerebrum: The cerebrum, also known as the telencephalon, is the largest and most highly developed part of the human brain. It encompasses about two-thirds of the brain mass and lies over and around most of the structures
The Cerebrum. Dr. C. George Boeree. The cerebrum -- which is just Latin for brain -- is the newest (evolutionarily) and largest part of the brain as a whole. It is here that things like perception, imagination, thought, judgment, and decision occur. The surface of the cerebrum -- the cerebral cortex -- is composed of six thin layers of neurons, which sit on top of a large collection of white matter pathways. The cortex is heavily convoluted, so that if you were to spread it out, it would actually take up about 2 1/2 square feet (2500 sq cm)
