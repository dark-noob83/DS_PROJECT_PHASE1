Well, if the liver enzymes were truly elevated secondary to drinking alone, then they should have gone down after cessation of alcohol-because alcohol is a toxin to the liver. I had a physical 3 years ago and my Doctor told me I had high enzymes and should stop drinking for 30 days and re-test. Unfortunately, I didn't take it seriously. I finally stopped drinking 45 days ago and re-tested my enzymes came back higher than before. I thought they would go down but they didn't
ALD includes three conditions: fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Heavy drinking for as little as a few days can lead to “fatty” liver, or steatosis—the earliest stage of alcoholic liver disease and the most common alcohol–induced liver disorder. ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE. The liver is one of the largest and most complex organs in the body. It stores vital energy and nutrients, manufactures proteins and enzymes necessary for good health, protects the body from disease, and breaks down (or metabolizes) and helps remove harmful toxins, like alcohol, from the body.

Excess intake of vitamin A, taken for years, can damage the liver. It is estimated that more than 30% of the U. S. population takes supplements of vitamin A, and some individuals are taking vitamin A at high doses that may be toxic to the liver (greater than 40,000 units/ day).
Remove other risk factors for liver disease. Alcohol use is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes, but smoking and obesity can also lead to liver damage. If you smoke, stop. If you're overweight, making healthier lifestyle choices that include regular exercise and a healthy diet can lower your liver enzyme levels. AST and ALT are two enzymes associated with liver cell damage and inflammation. ALT is a better indication of liver damage, because AST is found in other organs besides the liver.
