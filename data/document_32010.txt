35-45 mm Hg. ---. The normal PaCO2 (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood) is 40mmHg. There is a normal range, which is 35-45mmHg. For those with COPD 60 or below is good.
The normal PaCO2 (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood) is 40mmHg.
pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) reflects the the amount of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the blood. Indirectly, the pCO2 reflects the exchange of this gas through the lungs to the outside air. Two factors each have a significant impact on the pCO2.
Person pH is in normal range PCO2 is low (acid) and PCO2 is the respiratory component HCO3- is high (alkalosis) and HCO3- is the metabolic component When the PCO2 and HCO3- are both out of range but the pH is within range the person had a problem but has fully compensated for it.
