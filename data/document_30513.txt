Pyroclastic Flow. There is another type of flow that comes from a volcanic eruption that is much more dangerous than a lava flow, and that is a pyroclastic flow. A pyroclastic flow is a dense collection of fragments and gases from a volcanic eruption that flows down the slope of a volcano. You can recall this term by remembering that the prefix 'pyro' means 'fire,' and the suffix 'clastic' means 'fragments.' So a pyroclastic flow is literally the 'flow of fiery fragments.'.
Pyroclastic flows are fluidized masses of rock fragments and gases that move rapidly in response to gravity.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. A pyroclastic flow is a fluidized mixture of solid to semi-solid fragments and hot, expanding gases that flows down the flank of a volcanic edifice.
A pyroclastic flow is essentially an avalanche of ash, rock, and gas that flows down the slopes of a volcano at great speed. Temperatures inside these flows can be well over 1 â€¦ ,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is unsurvivable for any human, plant, or animal.
Pyroclastic Flow. A pyroclastic flow is a sudden, quick, and very hot movement of gases, dust, ash and/or rock mixtures due to volcanic eruptions that move across the ground at high speeds. Tweet.
