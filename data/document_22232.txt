Lymphocytes-A Normal Range. In blood tests, the lymphocyte level can be analysed, with their value will be seen in the CBC section. Its value is calculated per millilitre of blood, the normal range of lymphocytes is between 1300 and 4000 cells / ml. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that is distinguished from the rest by a lack of granules, and they have a key role in the immune system as they are able to respond to unknown agents. If you wan to know about the normal range of lymphocytes, OneHowTo can explain more.
81 Followers. A. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell. White blood cells are part of your immune system and help your body fight off diseases, including infections and cancer. There are two main types of lymphocytes â€“ B cells and T cells. B cells make antibodies that attack bacteria and toxins in the body
Studies show that B cell and T cell lymphocytes can prevent the control of cancerous cells. Lymphocytes comprise 15 to 40 percent of the total number of white blood cells in the human body. A decrease or increase in the normal range of lymphocytes can indicate infections or health conditions. This is also as dangerous as high lymphocyte count in the blood. When the percentage in white blood cells is less than 15 percent, it can cause lymphocytopenia. Low lymphocytes can hint at the possible underlying conditions 1  -. Aplastic anemia.
Normal lymphocyte count in blood. 1  The normal levels of lymphocytes present in the blood usually range between 1200 and 3200 lymphocytes per milliliter of blood. 2  However, it may be noted that different laboratories may follow different standards of valuing the normal levels of lymphocytes. A number of studies have indicated that B cell and T cell lymphocytes are also instrumental in preventing and controlling the development of dangerous cancerous cells. The lymphocytes form about 15 percent to 40 percent of the total number of white blood cells present in the body. A decrease or increase in the normal levels of lymphocytes is considered as abnormal and usually an indication of the presence of some infections or health condition
The normal range of lymphocytes in the blood is usually between 1200 and 3200 lymphocytes per milliliter of blood. Please note that different medical laboratories have different evaluation standards for finding the normal lymphocyte count. This is also as dangerous as high lymphocyte count in the blood. When the percentage in white blood cells is less than 15 percent, it can cause lymphocytopenia. Low lymphocytes can hint at the possible underlying conditions 1  -. Aplastic anemia.
Approximately 15% to 40% of white blood cells are lymphocytes. It is important to keep in mind that the. ranges mentioned above will be different depending on the machine used to do the blood test. Always. use the normal range printed on the lab report to decide what range is normal. T cells (also known as T lymphocytes) are types of lymphocyte that circulate through the thymus gland. and have turned into cells known as thymocytes (cells that have developed in the thymus gland).

There are three main types of lymphocytes: B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymphocytes compose approximately 15 to 40% of the total white blood cells in the body. In a healthy adult a lymphocyte count of 1000 - 4800 cells per microliter of blood is considered the normal range. For adults, a lymphocyte count of less than 1000 cells per microliter of blood is considered a low number of lymphocytes in his blood. Lymphocytopenia or lymphopenia are alternate terms for low lymphocyte counts.
