That’s just barely over six figures. The average salary of a WNBA player for the 2012 season was $72,000 while the league minimum rests just above $35,000 for rookies. Players with three or more years experience earn at least $51,000. $72,000 is still a decent check to people earning thousands lesser. Gilbert Arenas, a washed up NBA player who hasn’t come close to playing even half a season since 2007 and isn’t even on a team roster this year, will still earn (for lack of a better word) $45 million over the next two years because of a guaranteed $111 million contract he signed in 2008.
This average increases to $52,000 after three years, and as high as $103,000 after six years. These figures do not include numerous bonuses that are often rewarded throughout the season, ranging anywhere from $1000-$15,000 each. For example, a team winning the WNBA championship may earn a $10,000 bonus.

Griner, who was the top pick of the 2013 WNBA Draft by the Phoenix Mercury, made $49,440 her rookie season. A few weeks after her rookie season, Griner left for the Women's Chinese Basketball Association where she played three months for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls and made $600,000 according to ESPN the Magazine. Maya Moore, who was the top pick in the 2011 draft, makes $59,552 per season in the WNBA and at least $600,000 playing in China. The 12-team WCBA limits rosters to one non-Asian player which may be why more money can be thrown at American stars. But China is not alone in attracting American women.
WNBA Salary Minimum. According to the website Women's Basketball Online, as of February 2011 the minimum salary for a Women's National Basketball Association player with less than three years of experience is $36,570.

The salary cap for a WNBA team doesn’t even reach the $1 million mark. It sits at $878,000. The NBA’s is $58 million. On top of that, you don’t have to be a genius to see that not as many people are buying tickets to WNBA games or buying as much merchandise. Gilbert Arenas, a washed up NBA player who hasn’t come close to playing even half a season since 2007 and isn’t even on a team roster this year, will still earn (for lack of a better word) $45 million over the next two years because of a guaranteed $111 million contract he signed in 2008.
While the Women’s National Basketball Association may not be as popular as the NBA itself, it has grown steadily in viewership over the years.

For example, a team winning the WNBA championship may earn a $10,000 bonus.

Gilbert Arenas, a washed up NBA player who hasn’t come close to playing even half a season since 2007 and isn’t even on a team roster this year, will still earn (for lack of a better word) $45 million over the next two years because of a guaranteed $111 million contract he signed in 2008.
