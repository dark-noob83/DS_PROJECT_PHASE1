Costs associated with this treatment will vary widely based on conditions at the site, but are relatively low compared to other treatments. The average cost for a basic sign ranges from $30 to $150 plus installation costs of approximately $200 per sign [PEDSAFE, 2004].
We put in crosswalks to improve pedestrian safety, and to get people walking in the city, as part of our Walking Plan and Transportation Strategic Plan. We install 4 kinds of crosswalks across Surrey. 1  Standard marked crosswalk. 2  Enhanced marked crosswalk. 3  Activated flashing
Costs range from an average of approximately $750 for a striped crosswalk to nearly $2,600 for a high visibility crosswalk (Bushell, Poole, Zegeer, Rodriguez, 2013). Maintenance costs should also be considered based on the paint material used.
â€œThe average cost of installing a zebra crosswalk is $10,000 per intersection. The cost of a regular crosswalk is about $1,000 or $4,000 per intersection. To replace 53 crosswalks will cost over half a million dollars. Too embark on a city-wide effort will cost quite a bit more. There are 19,770 marked crosswalks in the city.
It may be helpful to install marked crosswalks at signalized intersections or locations where crosswalks are typically marked, at key crossings in neighborhoods with designated school walking routes, and at certain types of uncontrolled crossings.
