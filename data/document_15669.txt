Penguin Endangered. It is no secret that for almost all of the species of penguins out there, the numbers are less than they were just a few decades ago. There are many reasons for this including hunting them for oil, taking their eggs, destroying their natural environment, the weather, and a lack of food supply.
It is due to those facts that all of the species of penguins in the world are protected. There are laws that prevent them from being hunted and from their eggs being taken. However, we all know such efforts still take place on a large scale.
Adult Adelie Penguins have no land based predators due to the uncompromising conditions that they inhabit. In the water however, the biggest threat to the Adelie Penguin is the Leopard Seal, which is one of the southern-most species of Seal and a dominant predator in the Southern Ocean.

Effects of Climate Change. Climate change is a growing concern for penguins that live in Antarctica—the emperor penguin and the Adelie penguin. These species depend on sea ice for access to food and for places to breed. But the sea ice has been disappearing, and penguin populations along with it.
Adelie Penguin Distribution and Habitat. The Adelie Penguin is one of the southern-most Birds in the world as it is found along the Antarctic coastline and on the islands close to it. During the winter months, the Adelie Penguins migrate north where they inhabit large platforms of ice and have better access to food.
