Micro-SFA is also a good platform for alternative methods of analysis that use in-line dialysis, in-line distillation and/or UV digestion, fluorometry, UV detection, flame photometry, etc. Consult with an API representative to determine the best automated platform (micro-SFA or Discrete) for your laboratory.
Continuous Segmented Flow Instruments SEAL Analytical offers three different instruments utilising Continuous Segmented Flow Analysis. The QuAAtro HR (micro flow), the AA3 HR (macro flow) and the AA1 are ideal depending on the throughput & space needs of your laboratory.
1.3 This method can be used by analysts experienced with equipment using segmented flow analysis (SFA) and flow injection analysis (FIA) or working under the close supervision of such qualified persons. 1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard.

1) Segmented-Flow Analysis (SFA) The reaction stream is segmented with bubbles of air or nitrogen to reduce inter-sample dispersion. 2) Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) There are no air bubbles in the reaction stream.
Astoria-Pacific International is a manufacturer of continuous flow analyzers using segmented flow technology (segmented flow analyzers, micro-SFA systems). Astoria-Pacific manufactures fully automated, modulal and integrated micro-flow SFA analyzers and a line of additional modular components.
Segmented Flow Analyzer.  The AA1 is a fully automated analyzer employing new technology based on segmented flow analysis for rapid, accurate, precise analysis of parameters such as ammonia, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chloride.
