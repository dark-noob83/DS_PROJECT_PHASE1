In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. DNA-binding proteins are proteins that are composed of DNA-binding domains and thus have a specific or general affinity for either single or double stranded DNA. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins generally interact with the major groove of B-DNA, because it exposes more functional groups that identify a base pair.
Phage DNA packaging occurs by DNA translocation into a preformed protein shell--a prohead--with the aid of a packaging enzyme or a terminase. The packaging enzyme is composed of two subunits: the large subunit has ATP-binding, prohead binding, and DNA cleavage activities, and the small subunit is a DNA binding protein. DNA translocation is driven by ATP hydrolysis. In general, phage DNA replication mechanisms lead to the accumulation of concatemers
The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes shortens the fiber length about sevenfold. In other words, a piece of DNA that is 1 meter long will become a string-of-beads chromatin fiber just 14 centimeters (about 6 inches) long. The haploid human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA packaged into 23 chromosomes. Of course, most cells in the body (except for female ova and male sperm) are diploid, with 23 pairs of
DNA packaging. Each chromosome consists of one continuous thread-like molecule of DNA coiled tightly around proteins, and contains a portion of the 6,400,000,000 basepairs (DNA building blocks) that make up your DNA. The way DNA is packaged into chromatin is a factor in how protein production is controlled. Transcript: In this animation we'll see the remarkable way our DNA is tightly packed up so that six feet of this long molecule fits into the microscopic nucleus of every cell. The process starts when DNA is wrapped around special protein molecules called histones.
Histones are the major proteins involved in this packaging. 1  The binding of the chromosomal DNA to histones is the first level of packaging. 2  The DNA-histone protein complex is called the chromatin. 3  There are 5 types of histones namely, H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. 1 The DNA-histone protein complex is called the chromatin. 2  There are 5 types of histones namely, H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. 3  These are basic proteins (25% of basic amino acids lysine and arginine) and negatively charged DNA (due to the presence of phosphate group) can easily bind to these positively charged proteins.
The answer to this question lies in the fact that certain proteins compact chromosomal DNA into the microscopic space of the eukaryotic nucleus. These proteins are called histones, and the resulting DNA-protein complex is called chromatin. The haploid human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA packaged into 23 chromosomes. Of course, most cells in the body (except for female ova and male sperm) are diploid, with 23 pairs of

Figure 1: Chromosomes are composed of DNA tightly-wound around histones. Chromosomal DNA is packaged inside microscopic nuclei with the help of histones. These are positively-charged proteins that strongly adhere to negatively-charged DNA and form complexes called nucleosomes. Each nuclesome is composed of DNA wound 1.65 times around eight histone proteins. Nucleosomes fold up to form a 30-nanometer chromatin fiber, which forms loops averaging 300 nanometers in length. The haploid human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA packaged into 23 chromosomes. Of course, most cells in the body (except for female ova and male sperm) are diploid, with 23 pairs of
Summary. DNA is tightly packed in the nucleus of every cell. DNA wraps around special proteins called histones, which form loops of DNA called nucleosomes. These nucleosomes coil and stack together to form fibers called chromatin. Chromatin in turn forms larger loops and coils to form chromosomes. DNA is tightly packed in the nucleus of every cell.
