The Flammable Range (Explosive Range) is the range of a concentration of a gas or vapor that will burn (or explode) if an ignition source is introduced. Below the explosive or flammable range the mixture is too lean to burn and above the upper explosive or flammable limit the mixture is too rich to burn. 
the most flammable gas on the periodic table is hydrogen this is because it has an electron configuration of 1 and watns to bounce around to stabilize itself so it tries to f … orm a noble gas(inert gas). + 3 others found this useful.

A lot of methane is trapped under ice in the arctic. The leaf and animal matter sink and rot and form methane, but the methane is trapped under the frozen ice.
Subclass 2.3 Poison Gas. Gas poisonous by inhalation means a material which is a gas at 20°C or less and a pressure of 101.3 kPa (a material which has a boiling point of 20°C or less at 101.3kPa (14.7 psi)) and which: 1. is known to be so toxic to humans as to pose a hazard to health during transportation, or. This is an optional placard to the 2.2 Non-flammable Gas placard for compressed Oxygen in either the gas or liquid state. Oxygen is considered a non-flammable because it in and of itself does not burn. It is, however, required for combustion to take place
454 kg (1001 lbs) of any material which is a gas at 20°C (68°F) or less and 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) of pressure (a material which has a boiling point of 20°C (68°F) or less at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi)) which-. 1. Is ignitable at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) when in a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air; or. 2.

Definition. 1  Is ignitable at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) when in a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air; or. 2  Has a flammable range at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) with air of at least 12 percent regardless of the lower limit. 
flammable gas. Gas that at ambient temperature and pressure forms a flammable mixture with air at a concentration of 12 percent (or less) by volume. Definition. Gas that at ambient temperature and pressure forms a flammable mixture with air at a concentration of 12 percent (or less) by volume.
