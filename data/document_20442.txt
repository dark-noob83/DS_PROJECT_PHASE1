It is a solitary animal, found in many habitats, including grasslands, deciduous forests, and rainforests. It feeds mainly on ants and termites, sometimes up to 30,000 insects in a single day. Anteaters live in the rain-forest. This means they can be found  from Mexico in South America all the way to Uruguay and Argentina  in Central America.

Anteaters are found in Central and South America, where they prefer tropical forests and grasslands. There are four different species which vary greatly in size. The silky anteater is the size of a squirrel, while the giant anteater can reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) long from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail. Some anteaters, the tamandua and the silky anteater, ply their trade in the trees. They travel from branch to branch in search of tasty insects. Anteaters are not aggressive but they can be fierce. A cornered anteater will rear up on its hind legs, using its tail for balance, and lash out with dangerous claws. The giant anteater's claws are some four inches (ten centimeters) long, and the animal can fight off even a puma or jaguar.

Not only are giant anteaters the largest of the anteater species, but their snouts are longer and more slender than those of the collared anteaters. The giant anteaters are found in Central and South America.
