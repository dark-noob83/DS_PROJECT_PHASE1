Working in a foreign country requires a work permit or visa. In Singapore, your monthly salary determines whether you need to apply for an Employment Pass or a Work Visa. Employment Passes are meant for professionals who make more than $2,800 a month and Work Visas for those who make less than that amount. Employment Passes are further divided into P and Q qualifications.
