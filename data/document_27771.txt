The best interests doctrine is an aspect of parens patriae, and in the United States it has replaced the Tender Years Doctrine, which rested on the basis that children are not resilient, and almost any change in a child's living situation would be detrimental to their well-being. The Best Interests standard has received considerable criticism by certain groups within the privacy rights and family law reform movement, particularly with regard to how it unlawfully marginalizes children from one of their parents absent a compelling government interest, and often cultivates protracted litigation.
Best interests or best interests of the child is the doctrine used by most courts to determine a wide range of issues relating to the well-being of children. The most important of these issues concern questions that arise upon the divorce or separation of the children's parents. The Best Interests standard has received considerable criticism by certain groups within the privacy rights and family law reform movement, particularly with regard to how it unlawfully marginalizes children from one of their parents absent a compelling government interest, and often cultivates protracted litigation.
The best interests of the child doctrine is sometimes used in cases where non-parents, such as grandparents, ask a court to order non-parent visitation with a child.

The Family Law Amendment Act 2003 empowered the Family Court to distribute the debts of parties in the same way as property, and to make orders, for example, that a creditor (like a bank) must substitute one party for another in relation to responsibility for a debt. Under the Family Law Amendment (De facto Financial Matters and other Measures) Act 2008 de facto couples (including same-sex couples) can now access Commonwealth law and Commonwealth courts in relations to property distribution and other financial matters at the end of their relationships.
The Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) established the Family Court of Australia and a uniform code for divorce and issues arising on marital breakdown such as property settlements and parenting disputes (‘matrimonial causes’).

The laws governing child custody vary in each state. It is in the best interests of every parent to learn as much as possible before the child custody process begins.When parents cannot agree on their own about child custody issues, the case will go to court and a judge will decide the details of a custody agreement. If the parents are unable to agree on child custody, a temporary child custody schedule may be ordered by the family court judge. Temporary child custody is not a permanent custody determination. Final custody is determined in either the divorce proceedings or during a custody trial.

The Family Law Act makes clear that: 1  both parents are responsible for the care and welfare of their children until the children reach 18, and. 2  there is a presumption that arrangements which involve shared responsibilities and cooperation between the parents are in the best interests of the child. 1 Any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family. 2  Any family violence order that applies to the child or a member of the child’s family, if: 3  the order is a final order, or. 4  the making of the order was contested by a person.
Before the 2006 reforms, the legal position in family law in Australia was similar to that here. The welfare of the child was the paramount consideration in all court decisions,[71] and the courts used a checklist of factors to guide judicial discretion.[72] 51. In oral evidence, Craig Pickering, the CEO of Families Need Fathers, said the Children Act 1989 says that family court decisions should be in the best interests of the child, but actually nobody has ever set out what that means.
