Since the introduction of the Bravo Company KMR, BCM has threaten to produce a KeyMod rail panel. Well, after rejecting the first two development generations, BCM final settled on a design. From what we hear and see, BCM perfected their KeyMod panel, with a Snap-in feature. The KMR Snap-in panel is thin, radiused to match the cylindrical contour of the rail system and aggressively textured. According to BCM, these panels will be available in all four popular colors; Black, F ... RailScales are a KeyMod rail panel machined from G10 (Composite Fiberglass material blended with a phoenolic resin). At the time they only offered one style in two lengths, 2.5 and 4-inches. Now RailScales is offering a Honey Comb textured panel, once again in
KeyMod is a universal interface system for firearm accessory components designed to be superior to the MIL-STD-1913 accessory rails. VLTOR Weapon Systems had previously pursued a design which was the basis for the KeyMod system. While developing the first prototype systems Eric Kincel of VLTOR Weapon systems was approached by John Noveske of Noveske Rifleworks with a design for a universal accessory attachment system.
KeyMod is designed to let an accessory pass through standard slots that are indexed on the interior wall. This allows the user to attach and remove accessories, like grips, sling points and rails without having to remove the KeyMod-bearing surface. It is designed to compliment, not replace, Picatinny rail systems. 
The goal is to eliminate the need for the heavy and often non-ergonomic MIL-STD-1913 accessory rails. The KeyMod system consists of two parts: the KeyMod slot and the KeyMod nut. The slot is distinctive with a larger diameter through-hole combined with a narrow slot. The slot is chamfered on the backside while the through hole is sized for clearance of a quick-detach sling swivel (approximately 3/8 diameter).

The name KeyMod was coined by Eric Kincel (then working for VLTOR Weapon Systems) following the naming trend of other VLTOR accessories with the suffix Mod meaning modular, and Key being a reference to the key-hole profile of the mounting slots.

A new rail system for your rifle is slowly catching on. Officially announced to the public in July 2012, the KeyMod mounting system uses old principles to lock down rails and accessories. 
The KeyMod and M-Lok systems do just that. Neither the KeyMod (right) nor M-Lok (left) systems are a replacement for the picatinny standard, but they complement it. Picatinny adapters like those above are the most common accessories for both systems.
Manticore Arms Inc. has finally entered the world of KeyMod. For a while now, Manticore was normally known for their Patent Pending ARC-Lok interface system, but now they’ve added the KeyMod interface to their line-up. Manticore’s recent addition is the MA-11200 ALFA Rail for AK47/AKM/AK74 and AK100 series rifle. RailScales are a KeyMod rail panel machined from G10 (Composite Fiberglass material blended with a phoenolic resin). At the time they only offered one style in two lengths, 2.5 and 4-inches. Now RailScales is offering a Honey Comb textured panel, once again in
Known as M-Lok, it is Magpuls attempt at industry wide standardization. Both systems have the same goal, but offer different solutions to the modular rail equation. KeyMod uses an attachment system with “keyholes” that allow accessories to slot in and then are tightened down with captured screws. The one thing both systems have going for them is super light weight, a 15.0″ KeyMod rail or 15.0″ M-LOK rail only weigh 9.8 oz. compared to 17.8 oz. for a slim quad rail or a monster 22.5 oz. for a full quad rail.
