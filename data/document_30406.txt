By Karen Y. Larkin. The average cost of house cleaning in the United States is $125 for a 1,000-2,000 square foot home, according to a study by Red Beacon. They reviewed more than 32,000 cleaning quotes to arrive at that number. Keep in mind, however, that this is only an average. 
How to Charge for Cleaning Houses. How much you charge for cleaning someone's house depends on the size of the house, the degree of the mess and how long you spend cleaning it. The number of people it takes to get a cleaning job done will also determine how much you should charge. You may end making less money if you decide to charge a flat rate, as some houses may take five hours to clean and some may only take an hour, even if they are the same size. If you are doing a routine maintenance cleaning of a house that will take less than hour, charging a flat rate may be more profitable.
House cleaning service (sometimes called maid service) varies in cost according to frequency of service, condition and size of home. Prices are generally based either on the number of rooms, the square footage or by the hour. 1 One-time cleaning of a 900-square foot two-bedroom apartment with five rooms, costs $74-$200. 2  A 1,300 square-foot single-story home with seven rooms runs $95-$300. 3  A 2,200 two-story three-bedroom home with nine rooms averages $149-$400.
If you are having one room cleaned, it's usually more cost-effective to charge by the hour. If you are having your whole home cleaned, they will typically charge by the square foot. Some other factors that may affect your rate include: You can negotiate with residential cleaning agencies to reach a fair price. Research shows that the average hourly cleaning rate for U.S. maid services is between $25 and $45 per hour, so keep that in mind when getting quotes. However, housekeepers and individuals have to work alone and can't get to as many houses in a day as a service, so they will charge above that average.
