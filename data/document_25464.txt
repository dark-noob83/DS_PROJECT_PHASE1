The Golgi apparatus (/ˈɡoʊldʒiː/), also known as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the Golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. It was identified in 1897 by the Italian physician Camillo Golgi and named after him in 1898.
Golgi bodies are found in both plant and animal cells. There may in fact be more Golgi bodies per cell in plant cells than in animal cells. Golgi Apparatus is found in both … animal and plant cells. It is known as dictyosomes in plant cells and Golgi complex in animal cells. But the function remains the same.
The function of the Golgi apparatus is that it modifies, sorts, and packages proteins. It receives protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prepares them for secretion from the cell. This often involves adding carbohydrates to the proteins to make glycoproteins.
The Golgi Apparatus, or Golgi Body, appears in both plant and animal cells. It's function is to receive food from the Endoplasmic Reticulum, package it, and send it to organel … les throughout the cell. Yes, both plant and animal cells have Golgi bodies/apparatus. 44 people found this useful.
The Golgi Apparatus. The Golgi apparatus (GA), also called Golgi body or Golgi complex and found universally in both plant and animal cells, is typically comprised of a series of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered sacs called cisternae that look something like a stack of deflated balloons.
The number of compartments in any one Golgi apparatus is usually between 3 and 8. The number of sets of Golgi apparatus in a cell can be as few as 1, as in many animal cells, or many hundreds as in some plant cells. Specialised secretory cells contain more sets of Golgi apparatus than do other cells.
