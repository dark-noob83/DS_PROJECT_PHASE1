The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. The table also shows four rectangular blocks: s-, p-d- and f-block. Six groups (columns) have names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases. The periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized.
Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864. They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat. Six groups (columns) have names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases. The periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements, and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized.
Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to complete the table. Only a few months after, Meyer published a virtually identical table. Some consider Meyer and Mendeleev the co-creators of the periodic table. 1 Thus the atomic weight of tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128. ( 2 Tellurium's atomic mass is 127.6, and Mendeleev was incorrect in his assumption that atomic mass must increase with position within a period.
Mendeleev realized that the physical and chemical properties of elements were related to their atomic mass in a 'periodic' way, and arranged them so that groups of elements with similar properties fell into vertical columns in his table. He was also able to work out the atomic mass of the missing elements, and so predict their properties. And when they were discovered, Mendeleev turned out to be right. For example, he predicted the properties of an undiscovered element that should fit below aluminum in his table.
This table and the accompanying observations were first presented to the Russian Chemical Society in March 1869. (Actually, Mendeleev was ill, and his colleague Nikolai Menshutkin presented his paper [Menschutkin 1934].) The paper was published in the first volume of the new society's journal. By ordering the elements according to increasing atomic weight in vertical rows so that the horizontal rows contain analogous elements, [1] still ordered by increasing atomic weight, one obtains the following arrangement, from which a few general conclusions may be derived.

(Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do this, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties missing elements),
Dmitri Mendeleev was a Russian chemist who lived from 1834-1907. He is considered to be the most important contributor to the development of the periodic table. His version of the periodic table organized elements into rows according to their atomic mass, and into columns based on chemical and physical properties. Using his table, Mendeleev was able to predict characteristics of undiscovered elements. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. While constructing his version of the periodic table, Mendeleev noticed that some spaces were better left empty, because there was no known element that had the necessary characteristics. Mendeleev hypothesized that these empty spaces were for elements that had not been discovered yet.
There were 60 known elements in 1860 when Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. The Periodic Table of Elements. CIENTISTS HAD IDENTIFIED over 60 elements by Mendeleev's time. (Today over 110 elements are known.) In Mendeleev's day the atom was considered the most basic particle of matter. 1.He left gaps gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered. (Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do this, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties missing elements),
Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up. In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends. Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn’t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev’s periodic table had been published. Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other’s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.
