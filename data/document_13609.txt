Insulin and glucagon work synergistically to keep blood glucose concentrations normal. Insulin: An elevated blood glucose concentration results in the secretion of insulin: glucose is transported into body cells. The uptake of glucose by liver, kidney and brain cells is by diffusion and does not require insulin.
Glucagon causes the liver to release stores of glucose from hepatic polymers called glycogen, it also signals the liver to start a process called gluconeogenesis, in which glucose is produced from amino-acids after hepatic glycogen stores are depleted.
1 Under the influence of insulin, much of this glucose is stored in the form of glycogen. 2  Later, when blood glucose levels begin to fall, glucagon is secreted and acts on hepatocytes to activate the enzymes that depolymerize glycogen and release glucose. 3  Glucagon activates hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreas when blood glucose is low. Blood glucose is low between meals and during exercise. When blood glucose is high, no glucagon is secreted from the alpha cells. Glucagon has the greatest effect on the liver although it affects many different cells in the body. Glucagon's function is to cause the liver to release stored glucose from its cells into the blood. Glucagon also the production of glucose by the liver out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body, for example, protein [ 4 ].
Glucagon is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas and has variety of effects. These include increasing the conversion of glycogen, which is stored in the liver, into glucose, which can be used by the body's cells from energy. Glucagon also stimulates the body's use of proteins and fats for energy.
