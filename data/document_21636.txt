A herniated nucleus pulposus has the potential to irritate nerves, thereby causing pain, numbness or weakness in a limb. A person experiencing any of these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately. However, many people with herniated discs experience no symptoms.
By Michael Perry, M.D. A herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) causes many patients to experience aches and pains in the neck and back. This spinal condition occurs when the jellylike center (nucleus pulposus) of an intervertebral disc seeps through a tear in the tough exterior (annulus fibrosus) and into the spinal column. While there are several factors that can lead to developing a herniated disc, there are two main causes:
Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus. The tear causes pain; when the disk impinges on an adjacent nerve root, a segmental radiculopathy with paresthesias and weakness in the distribution of the affected root results.
Herniated Nucleus Pulposus-treatment and symptoms. Herniated Nucleus Pulposus-Damage to the structure of the CARTILAGE that cushions the vertebrae, also called a herniated, slipped, or ruptured disk.
A herniated disk, sometimes (incorrectly) called a slipped disk, is a common cause of severe back pain and sciatica. A disk in the lumbar area becomes herniated when it ruptures or thins out, and degenerates to the point that the gel within the disk (the nucleus pulposus) pushes outward.
Causes. The most common cause of a cervical herniated nucleus pulposus is gradual degeneration of the disc, attenuation (weakening) of the posterior annulus fibrosis, and subsequent protrusion of the nucleus pulposus into the spinal canal causing compression of the nerve root.
