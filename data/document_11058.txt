Radiculopathy is a condition due to a compressed nerve in the spine that can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness along the course of the nerve. Radiculopathy can occur in any part of the spine, but it is most common in the lower back (lumbar radiculopathy) and in the neck (cervical radiculopathy).
Types of radiculopathy are defined by the location of the compressed nerve: 1  Lumbar radiculopathy is pressure on the nerve root in the lower back. 2  It can cause sciatica, or shooting pain in the legs. 3  Incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or severe paralysis can also occur in severe cases.
Radiculopathy. Radiculopathy is the term for a pinched nerve or nerves along the spine. Pressure where the nerve connects to the spine (nerve root) can cause pain, weakness and other symptoms. In radiculopathy, the pain source is at the root of the nerve where it connects to
Radiculopathy is the term for one or more pinched nerves or nerve roots along the spine. Pressure where the nerve connects to the spine (nerve root) can cause pain, weakness and other symptoms.
The most common symptoms of radiculopathy are pain, numbness, and tingling in the arms or legs. It is common for patients to also have localized neck or back pain as well. Lumbar radiculopathy that causes pain that radiates down a lower extremity is commonly referred to as sciatica.
Radiculopathy is a pinched nerve in the spine. It occurs when surrounding bones, cartilage, muscle, or tendons deteriorate or are injured. The trauma causes these tissues to change position so that they exert extra pressure on the nerve roots in the spinal cord. When the nerve roots are compressed, they become inflamed.
Lumbar radiculopathy is chronic pain in the lower back and legs, which is caused by nerve damage to the lower spine. Sensations of pain caused by lumbar radiculopathy. A form of radiculopathy, sciatica can cause pain and numbness down the leg.
