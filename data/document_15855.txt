Gram-positive bacteria retain a purple-colored stain, while Gram-negative bacteria appear pinkish or red. Gram-negative bacteria can cause many types of infections and are spread to humans in a variety of ways. Several species, including Escherichia coli, are common causes of food–borne disease.
Negative Stain. The negative stain is particularly useful for determining cell size and arrangement. It can also be used to stain cells that are too delicate to be heat-fixed. We use nigrosin as our negative stain. Nigrosin is an acidic stain.
Gram-negative bacteria can also cause respiratory infections, such as certain types of pneumonia, and sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea. Yersinia pestis, the Gram-negative bacterium responsible for plague, is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected insect or handling an infected animal. The image on the left shows Gram-positive bacteria, which retain a purple stain. The image on the right is Gram-negative bacteria, which appear pink or red.
A gram stain is a type of microbiology or laboratory test that determines whether bacteria are present. It also determines whether bacteria are gram negative or gram positive. The difference between gram negative and gram positive bacteria can be important when determining appropriate treatment for an infection.
Negative Staining Negative staining is a rapid procedure used for viewing small particles, such as viruses, in fluids. For specimen processing, large particles (e.g., bacteria or cell debris) should be centrifuged out at a low speed (e.g., at ∼2,000 × g) for 3 to 5 min.
A carbol fuschin counter-stain is then applied which stains the Gram-negative bacteria pink. Modifications: The Brown-Hopps and Brown-Brenn stains are modifications of the Gram stain and are used for demonstration of gram negative bacteria and rickettsia.
