The centimeter (British spelling: centimetre, abbreviation and symbol: cm) is a unit of length in the SI system (metric system). One cm is equal to one hundredth of the meter (British spelling: metre), which is the current SI base unit of length. One centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm) = 0.01 meter (m) = 0.1 decimeters (dm) = 0.00001 kilometers (km) = 0.393700787401 inch (in) = 0.032808399 feet (ft) = 0.010936133 yards (yd).
