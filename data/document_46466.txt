2010]. Grapefruit juice inhibited the first-pass metabolism of oxycodone by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver; consequently, oxycodone plasma concentrations were significantly increased by 50% and the half-life was extended by 20%.
Grapefruit Juice Alters Oxycodone Concentration. Grapefruit juice alters the concentrations of many CYP3A4 liver enzyme substrates, including some but not all opioid analgesics.
Except as noted the same effects which are shown for hydrocodone also apply to oxycodone. The effects of dihydrocodeine (Synalgos DC) are to an extent like a half again stronger version of codeine, but the euphoria has some hydrocodone elements to it, about a 60-40 split.
White grapefruit juice contains three ingredients that clog the CYP450 set. However, it doesn't clog CYP2D6 too well, which is the main one for most opes. It does strongly 'clog' CYP3A4 nicely though, and although that's almost an 'auxillary' enzyme for alot of opiates, it definitely helps out. Again, it's cheap. Go to any grocery store and you should be able to get a nice big bottle of 100% whitre grapefruit juice from concentrate for like $2.50-$3.50.
A lot of companies make White grapefruit juice that is basically water, corn syrup, and like 10% juice. This is almost a waste of your money. You want it to say 100% juice, and also, you want to make sure it's 100% white grapefruit juice!
That said, to get the ABSOLUTE MOST out of your opiate, try N0 W4RN1NG's patented opioid potentiation formula: * T-45) 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
Researchers in Finland had 12 healthy volunteers ingest about 7 ounces (200 mL) of grapefruit juice three times a day (about 2.5 cups/day) for 5 days, and 10 mg oxycodone was administered on day 4 [Nieminen et al.
