An ad hoc network is a type of temporary computer-to-computer connection. In ad hoc mode, you can set up a wireless connection directly to another computer without having to connect to a Wi-Fi access point or router.
Basically, an ad hoc network is a temporary network connection created for a specific purpose (such as transferring data from one computer to another). If the network is set up for a longer period of time, it is just a plain old local area network (LAN). Cite this definition:
To set up an ad-hoc wireless network, each wireless adapter must be configured for ad-hoc mode versus the alternative infrastructure mode. In addition, all wireless adapters on the ad-hoc network must use the same SSID and the same channel number.
1. An ad-hoc network is a local area network (LAN) that is built spontaneously as devices connect. Instead of relying on a base station to coordinate the flow of messages to each node in the network, the individual network nodes forward packets to and from each other.
Tip: Create an Ad Hoc Wireless Network. If you want to share information stored on your computer with other people nearby and everyoneâ€™s computer has a wireless network adapter, a simple method of sharing is to set up an ad hoc wireless network.
Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up an ad hoc Wi-Fi network. A Wi-Fi network in ad hoc (also known as computer-to-computer or peer) mode allows two or more devices to communicate with each other directly instead of through a central wireless router or access point.
You can share an Internet connection through an ad hoc network, but keep in mind that the Internet connection is then available to anyone logging on to a computer that is connected to the network, and thus is likely not very secure. To set up an ad hoc network: 1.
The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a pre existing infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks.
