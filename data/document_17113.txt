How much annual leave? Most full-time workers are entitled to four weeks paid annual leave for every 12 months worked. Employees who regularly work shifts on Sundays and public holidays in businesses that operate 24 hours a day for seven days per week are entitled to an extra week of paid annual leave.
If you take more paid annual leave than you are entitled to, the excess leave is treated as unpaid leave, and your employer can deduct your salary accordingly. Your employer should therefore keep a record of all your leave applications, whether paid or unpaid.
You can ask your employer to pay you up to one week of your four weeks minimum holiday in cash. If you do this you will no longer be able to take the time you cashed up as a holiday. For information about cashing up annual leave, see the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Labour Information website.
Cashing-up annual holidays. Employees are able to ask their employer to pay out in cash up to one week of their minimum entitlement to annual holidays per year. Cashing up annual holidays can only be at the employeeâ€™s request and the request must be made in writing.
