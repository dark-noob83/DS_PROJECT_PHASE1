One of the great mysteries of our Solar System is why Uranus is tilted on its side. Surely, if the solar system formed from the same rotating cloud of dust and gas, then all the bodies within it should rotate in the same way. And yet Uranus’ axis of rotation lies at 97 degrees to the plane of the solar system.
Yes, Uranus is really tilted on its side! Uranus has the largest tilt of any planet in our Solar System and it spins on its side. This means that one of Uranus' poles is often pointed towards the Sun, giving Uranus very long seasons. The rings of Uranus are also sideways compared to the rings of other planets.
The Earth’s axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees. This is why we have seasons on Earth. But the axis of Uranus is tilted so far it’s hard to imagine how it might have even happened. The axis of Uranus is tilted at an angle of 98-degrees compared to the Sun’s orbital plane. Uranus. Image credit: Hubble. While the rest of the planets in the Solar System can be thought of like spinning tops, Uranus is more like a rolling ball going around the Sun.
Of all the planets in the solar system, Uranus is probably the oddest. A cool blue planet, it rotates on its side! The faint ring system around the planet gives testament to the fact, and makes the sight even more interesting. It really is quite baffling, since such a tilt is unmatched by the other planets.
Uranus is a real oddball in our solar system. Its spin axis is tilted by a whopping 98 degrees, meaning it essentially spins on its side. No other planet has anywhere near such a tilt. Jupiter is tilted by 3 degrees, for example, and Earth by 23 degrees.
