Structure and Composition. The galaxy we live in, called the Milky Way Galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy composed of at least 100 billion stars. It is approximately 100,000 light years across and about 1000 light years thick. It has a central bulge that is about 10,000 light years in diameter.
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy and is part of the Local Group of galaxies. Ours is merely is one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. Our sun is 25,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way. The oldest star in the galaxy is 13.2 billion years old. The stellar disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is approximately 100,000 light years in diameter and is about 1,000 light years thick. It is estimated to contain up to 400 billion stars.

We live in an island of stars called the Milky Way, and many know that our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. In fact, it’s a barred spiral galaxy, which means that our galaxy probably has just two major spiral arms, plus a central bar that astronomers are only now beginning to understand.
