An introduction to Raman Spectroscopy. Simplified energy diagram. It is the shift in wavelength of the inelastically scattered radiation that provides the chemical and structural information. Raman shifted photons can be of either higher or lower energy, depending upon the vibrational state of the molecule under study. Hence, in Raman spectroscopy, only the more intense Stokes line is normally measuredRaman scattering is a relatively weak process. The number of photons Raman scattered is quite small. However, there are several process which can be used to enhance the sensitivity of a Raman measurement.
Raman spectroscopy (/ˈrɑːmən/ ; named after Sir C. V. Raman) is a spectroscopic technique used to observe vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system. Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It relies on inelastic scattering, or Raman scattering, of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range. The polarization of the Raman scattered light with respect to the crystal and the polarization of the laser light can be used to find the orientation of the crystal, if the crystal structure (to be specific, its point group) is known.
Raman spectroscopy provides information about molecular vibrations that can be used for sample identification and quantitation. The technique involves shining a monochromatic light source (i.e. laser) on a sample and detecting the scattered light. The majority of the scattered light is of the same frequency as the excitation source; this is known as Rayleigh or elastic scattering.
As with single molecules, a given solid material has characteristic phonon modes that can help an experimenter identify it. In addition, Raman spectroscopy can be used to observe other low frequency excitations of the solid, such as plasmons, magnons, and superconducting gap excitations. The polarization of the Raman scattered light with respect to the crystal and the polarization of the laser light can be used to find the orientation of the crystal, if the crystal structure (to be specific, its point group) is known.
The Raman spectra (Raman scattering intensity as a function of the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequency shifts) is dependent on the rovibronic (rotational and vibrational energy levels of the ground electronic state) states of the sample. The polarization of the Raman scattered light with respect to the crystal and the polarization of the laser light can be used to find the orientation of the crystal, if the crystal structure (to be specific, its point group) is known.
The Raman Spectrum. A Raman spectrum is a plot of the intensity of Raman scattered radiation as a function of its frequency difference from the incident radiation (usually in units of wavenumbers, cm -1). This difference is called the Raman shift
Raman is a light scattering technique, whereby a molecule scatters incident light from a high intensity laser light source. Most of the scattered light is at the same wavelength (or colour) as the laser source and does not provide useful information – this is called Rayleigh Scatter. Raman Spectroscopy is a non-destructive chemical analysis technique which provides detailed information about chemical structure, phase and polymorphy, crystallinity and molecular interactions.
The difference in energy between the incident photon and the Raman scattered photon is equal to the energy of a vibration of the scattering molecule. A plot of intensity of scattered light versus energy difference is a Raman spectrum. 1.1.1. A Raman spectrum is a plot of the intensity of Raman scattered radiation as a function of its frequency difference from the incident radiation (usually in units of wavenumbers, cm -1).
Raman Basics page 1 of 5 …SEE the Future Introduction Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique based on inelastic scattering of monochromatic light, usually from alaser source. Inelastic scattering means that the frequency of photons in monochromatic light changes upon interactionwith a sample. A photon with frequency υ 0 is absorbed by Raman-active molecule which at the time of interaction is in the basicvibrational state. Part of the photon’s energy is transferred to the Raman-active mode with frequency υ m and the resultingfrequency of scattered light is reduced to υ 0 - υ m.
