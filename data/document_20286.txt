SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China plans to launch a yuan-denominated gold fix by the end of 2015 via the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), in a move aimed at giving the world's biggest bullion producer and consumer more influence over pricing.

- Currency war to escalate. If China were to partially back its yuan with gold it would require a gold price of $64,000 per ounce, 50 times gold bullion’s price today, according to a recent article from respected Bloomberg Intelligence. It seems like an outlandish forecast.
Gold price in China in Chinese Yuan (CNY) is a free daily analysis about the current gold price in China in CNY. The following report covers average gold price per grem, ounce, and kilo gram in 24k, 21k, 18k, 14k, and 10k in China in Chinese Yuan (CNY).
Therefore, if China wishes to back the Renminbi with 75% gold, it needs a total of $2,475,000,000,000 in gold. And if it were possible to buy that much gold today at the current price of $1,230/oz, China would purchase 2,011,950,000 oz.
A move to a gold standard in China would require an exchange rate of as much as $64,000 an ounce, 50 times bullion’s price now, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Bloomberg conservatively estimate China’s gold reserves at around 3150 tonnes although many analysts believe the figure to be much higher. In order to back $5.4 trillion yuan with 3150 tonnes of gold, the gold price would need to be in the region of $48,600 per ounce. Bloomberg conclude that, at today’s prices, it would be “basically impossible” for China to fully back its yuan with gold.
