CFCs. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) is an organic compound that contains carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane. A common subclass is the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which contain hydrogen, as well. Freon is DuPont's brand name for CFCs, HCFCs and related compounds.

They are also commonly known by the DuPont brand name Freon. The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12).
Arctic Ozone Hole. CFCs Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) is an organic compound that contains carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as a volatile derivative of methane and ethane. A common subclass is the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which contain hydrogen, as well. Freon is DuPont's brand name for CFCs, HCFCs and related compounds.
A CFC is a molecule which consists of Chlorine, Fluorine and Carbon only. Ozone is destroyed due to the formation of a chlorine free radical. For example, the CFC CCl2F2 photo â€¦ -dissociates (decomposes due to UV rays) to form the chlorine free radical and this then reacts with ozone breaking it down into oxygen.
