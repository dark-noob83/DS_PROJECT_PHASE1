Without charities and non-profits, America would simply not be able to operate. Their operations are so big that during 2014, total giving was more than $358 billion. 1 As in previous years, the majority of that giving came from individuals. 2  Specifically, individuals gave roughly $258.5 billion (72%) representing a 5.7% increase over 2013 (4% when adjusted for inflation). 3  Giving by bequest was up 15.5% in current dollars (or 13.6% when adjusted for inflation) to $28.1

It is extremely important to get receipts and keep records for your donations. If you make a cash donation of less than $250, a canceled check or a receipt from the charity showing its name, the amount and the date of the contribution is sufficient. However, contributions of more than $250 require written documentation from the charitable organization. However, your deduction is limited to the excess of what you gave over the value of what you received. For example, if you gave $100 to a charity dinner and the dinner was worth $30, you can deduct $70. If you make a contribution of more than $75 and receive goods or services, the charity must give you a written statement that tells you the value of those goods or services
