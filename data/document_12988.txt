Existing estimates of the costs associated with HIV treatment and care in the US date from the early years of antiretroviral therapy. In 1998, it was calculated that the annual cost of treating a patient with HIV was $18,300. The average annual per patient cost of HIV treatment and care in the US was $19,912, investigators report in the online edition of AIDS. The analysis was based on 2006 figures. Costs were highest for those with a CD4 cell count below 50 cells/mm 3. This was due to the high cost of inpatient care

Over 1 million Americans live with HIV. While treatable, medical costs are often exorbitant. The CDC reports that the estimated lifetime cost of treating HIV is $379,000 (in 2010 dollars), and that nearly 30 percent of those living with the virus are uninsured.

Nov. 2, 2006 - People with HIV can get 24 extra years of life from modern treatments -- at a total cost of $618,900 in 2004 dollars. That finding comes from a Cornell/Johns Hopkins/Harvard/Boston University research team that analyzed the costs and benefits of modern HIV treatment. The cost of drugs is nearly three-fourths of the lifetime expense. Unfortunately, one in four people with HIV don't know they're infected. They find out only when their immune system collapses. The cost of treatment started at this late stage averages $4,700 per month.
1 Physicians are likely to prescribe one or more medications to treat HIV/AIDS. 2  Most private insurers cover the cost of HIV/AIDs treatments and medications, requiring covered members to be responsible for copays that typically range from $10-$30 per prescription. 1 Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are flawed versions of the building blocks used for HIV replication, meaning they disrupt the protein-duplication process. 2  Ziagen (abacavir) typically costs about $600 per month; the generic version is about $70 less. 3  Another NRTI, Truvada, costs about $1,200 per month.
1 Without insurance, annual HIV/AIDS treatment costs can cost $14,000-$20,000, according to Michael Kolber, a professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. 2  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors work by disabling a protein HIV needs to duplicate. 1 Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are flawed versions of the building blocks used for HIV replication, meaning they disrupt the protein-duplication process. 2  Ziagen (abacavir) typically costs about $600 per month; the generic version is about $70 less. 3  Another NRTI, Truvada, costs about $1,200 per month.
“The average cost of HIV treatment is $14,000 to $20,000 a year,” says Michael Kolber, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the Comprehensive AIDS Program and Adult HIV Services at University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida. Additional infections can also increase cost. For example, data suggests that a year of optimal HIV treatment costs $18,300 or more while 48 weeks of treatment for HIV and hepatitis C together will cost $29,000 or more.
