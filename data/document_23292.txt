In its annual survey of Tax Return Preparation Fee Averages, the National Society of Accountants reports the following average fees its members charged to prepare 2014 tax returns: 1  1040 with state return with no itemized deductions: $159. 2  1040 with Schedule A (itemized deductions) and state return: $273. The average fee at the national tax service firms H&R Block and Liberty Tax Service is $147 per return and $191 per return, respectively, according the firms' annual reports (information for Jackson Hewitt wasn't available, but it should be in that range).
Our fees are generally form-based. For example, if your tax return includes Form 1040, Schedule A, and Oregon Form 40, we would charge a fixed price for each these forms. For the 2015 filing season our fee for Form 1040 is $195, Schedule A is $56 and Oregon 40 is $45 for a total preparation fee of $296. Below is a table which outlines some of the most common tax return situations and our fees for preparing forms associated with these returns. Fees for preparing corporate and partnership returns vary according to the complexity of the tax return. The average fee ranges from $650 - $1,000 with some returns falling below or above these amounts.

The average fee at the national tax service firms H&R Block and Liberty Tax Service is $147 per return and $191 per return, respectively, according the firms' annual reports (information for Jackson Hewitt wasn't available, but it should be in that range).
Alert: The NSA's biennial survey of nearly 8,000 tax preparers showed the average tax preparation fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return is only $229. Even one extra deduction or tax credit can more than cover the fee paid to a professional tax preparer.. The survey found that tax preparation fees for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return averaged $217 at one-person firms and jumped slightly to $245 for firms with three or more staff. Firms with lower levels of gross income also charge less on average than larger companies
I just ran across a bit of interesting information on the cost of tax preparation from the National Society of Accountants. According to their biennial survey, the average tax prep fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A plus a state tax return is $229. For a Form 1040 and state return without itemized deductions, the average price drops to $129. Update: Be sure to check out this recent post from GetRichSlowly with tons of additional data on tax preparation costs for 2012. For those of us with more complex returns, here’s a rundown of average costs for other IRS tax forms: 1  $212 for Form 1040 Schedule C (profit or loss from business). 2  $551 for Form 1065 (partnership). 3  $692 for Form 1120 (corporation).
According to the survey, the average cost to prepare an itemized Form 1040 with a Schedule A (for itemized deductions) and a state tax return is $246. The average rate for a return without itemized deductions is lower: $143. “I think most people would say this is worth the money,” says NSA official John Ams. Here is the average fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return in different U.S. census districts: 1  New England (CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) – $237. 2  Middle Atlantic (NJ, NY, PA) – $258. 3  South Atlantic (DE, DC, FL, GA, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV) – $253. 4  East South Central (AL, KY, MS, TN) – $279
For example, tax preparation firms with gross annual income of $50,000 or less charge an average of $174 for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return, while a company with gross income of $400,000 or more charges an average of $305. Even one extra deduction or tax credit can more than cover the fee paid to a professional tax preparer.. The survey found that tax preparation fees for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return averaged $217 at one-person firms and jumped slightly to $245 for firms with three or more staff. Firms with lower levels of gross income also charge less on average than larger companies
As CPAs everywhere are burning the midnight oil, the National Society of Accountants (NSA) released the results of their 2009-2010 Fee Survey of nearly 8,000 tax preparers, which showed the average tax preparation fee for an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return to be $229.
