for a complete lesson on unit rate go to http www mathhelp com 1000 online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson in this lesson students learn that a rate is a comparison of two measurements or amounts that have different units for example 60 miles in 2 hours is a rate to find the unit rate divide the numerator and denominator of the given rate by the denominator of the given rate so in this case divide the numerator and denominator of 70 5 by 5 to get 14 1 or 14 students per class which is
for example 60 miles in 2 hours is a rate students learn that a unit rate is a rate in which the second rate is 1 unit for example 30 miles in 1 hour or 30 miles per hour is a unit rate in the problems in this lesson students are given a rate and are asked to find the corresponding unit
in each case the first quantity is related to 1 unit of the second quantity unit rates a rate is a ratio that is used to compare different kinds of quantities a unit rate describes how many units of the first type of quantity corresponds to one unit of the second type of quantity 
unit rates and unit ratios a unit rate is a ratio that has a denominator of 1 a unit rate is also called a unit ratio they mean the same thing frac 5 4 and $ 3 8 and $ 40 mbox to 10 are ratios but they are not unit ratios frac 1 25 1 and $ 0 375 1 and $ 4 mbox to 1 are unit ratios
understand the concept of a unit rate a b associated with a ratio a b with b unequal to 0 and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship for example this recipe has a ratio of 3 cups of flour to 4 cups of sugar so there is 3 4 cup of flour for each cup of sugar 
a rate is a ratio that compares two different units ex 300 miles 6 hours you can t convert miles into hours a unit rate is a rate comparing a number to 1 unit to anothe r ex 50 miles 1 hour a unit rate always has 1 as a denominator 
use this calculator to find the unit rate a rate is a ratio comparing 2 quantities of different kinds of units a unit rate is a rate with 1 in the denominator if a rate is given and the quantity in the denominator is not 1 unit rate is calculated by finding an equal ratio such that the denominator is 1 stated differently complete the division operation of the fraction or ratio the unit cost we want to know the price per unit apple so we set up our ratio with apples in the denominator we have our rate of 1 80 dollars per 3 apples 1 80 3 1 80 3 0 60 so ryan paid a unit price of $ 0 60 per apple
approximately 874 people per day wonder what a unit rate is if you re one of them check out our video on unit rates and how to use them we just made up that 874 number but it s no surprise we make up 22 numbers per minute here at shmoop share this video tweet facebook e mail
