Normal hemoglobin values are related to the person's age and sex. Normal values may vary slightly between test systems, and which groups of doctors have determined normal values for their group of patients; however, the value ranges are close (vary by about 0.5 g/dl) for almost every group.
In normal pregnancy the mean fetal haemoglobin increases linearly from 11 g/dl at 17 weeks' gestation to 15 g/dl at 40 weeks' gestation and one standard deviation is approximately 1 g/dl. The haemoglobin was also measured in fetal blood from 154 red cell isoimmunised pregnancies from 17 to 36 weeks' gestation.
Newborn: the Normal Hemoglobin Level ranges between 14 and 24 g/dl. Newborn to 2 weeks: Hemoglobin Normal Ranges between 12 and 20 g/dl. 2 to 6 months: Normal Hemoglobin Level Range is 10 to 17 g/dl. 6 to 12 months: Normal Hemoglobin Level ranges between 9.5 and 14 g/dl. 1 to 6 years: 9.5 to 14 g/dl. 6 to 18 years: 10 to 15.5 g/dl.
A. The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters. The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are: 1  Newborns: 17-22 gm/dL.
