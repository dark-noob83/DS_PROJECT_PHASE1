Belgians can be sorrel, chestnut, bay or gray, but the preferred color is a very light chestnut or sorrel color with creamy white mane and tail.

The Clydesdale is a breed of draught horse derived from the farm horses of Clydesdale, Scotland, and named after that region. Although originally one of the smaller breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often bay in colour, they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics. The breed was developed from Flemish stallions imported to Scotland and crossed with local mares. The first recorded use of the name Clydesdale for the breed was in 1826, and by 1830 a system of hiring stallions had begun that resulted in the spread of Clydesdale horses throughout Scotland and into northern England.
