Your down payment is the difference between the home value and the amount a lender is willing to finance, a percentage known as loan-to-value. For example, if the condo's appraised value is $200,000 and your lender can finance a maximum loan amount of $160,000, your down payment is $40,000. Forty thousand dollars equals 20 percent, therefore, your LTV is 80 percent. Buyers who use the condo for investment purposes or as a secondary residence may require 10 percent to 25 percent down, depending on the loan type and whether it's a Fannie or Freddie program.
A down payment is the amount of money you spend upfront to purchase a home and is typically combined with a mortgage to fulfill the total purchase price of a home. In addition to your down payment amount, your credit score, credit history, total debt and annual income will influence how much house you can qualify for. Typically you will need to save 5 to 20 percent of the sale price in cash in order to qualify for a conventional loan. If you put down less than 20 percent, you will have to pay mortgage insurance (either private or public depending on the type of loan). See more information about mortgage insurance.
For example, if you purchased a condo for $100,000, with a twenty percent down payment, you would pay $20,000 directly to the seller, and then you would need to obtain an $80,000 loan to pay the seller the rest of the purchase price. Down payment requirements vary depending on the type of loan you qualify for. Budget at least $3,000-$4,000 for the emergency fund, if not more. So, when you’re deciding how much of a down payment you can afford, keep these additional expenses in mind. Finally, remember that t he equity itself doesn’t work on a percentage basis.
1 You will need to pay PMI to your lender, which increases your monthly payments. 2  Your home loan will be larger, so your monthly payments will be larger, too. 3  Your interest rate will be a little higher, too, than for someone who makes a 20% down payment. If you make a down payment of 10% ($20,000 on the average home) or 5% ($10,000 on the average home), then you will be able to become a homeowner faster, since you won’t have to save as much cash.
BEST ANSWER. Paul Macapag, Agent, NY, NY. Tipically a min of 20% down is needed for most coop's.... Just keep in mind that not all coops are the same and there are coop's in NYC that will not let you take out a motgage on the property and require 100% down. 0 votes • Thank • Flag • Link • Wed Jul 11, 2007.

Co-op Extra: With a condo purchase, the amount of down payment is between you and your lender. With a co-op purchase, however, there is a third party that has a say: the co-op’s board. A co-op’s bylaws may require you to put in a much higher down payment, perhaps 50%, and in some cases up to 100%. Budget at least $3,000-$4,000 for the emergency fund, if not more.

Smaller Down Payment Pros and Cons. If you make a down payment of 10% ($20,000 on the average home) or 5% ($10,000 on the average home), then you will be able to become a homeowner faster, since you won’t have to save as much cash.
Down Payment. Most home buyers need a mortgage to finance their condo purchases, and lenders typically require a down payment. The size of your down payment depends on your lender and loan program. To get a condo loan with the Federal Housing Administration, you'll need at least 3.5 percent of the sale price.
PMI provides insurance to the lender in case you default on your loan. Buyer Advantages of 20% Down. In addition to eliminating the need for PMI, a 20% down payment will qualify you for a slightly lower interest rate than a borrower who makes a smaller down payment. Another benefit is that you will borrow less money, making your monthly payments smaller. If you make a down payment of 10% ($20,000 on the average home) or 5% ($10,000 on the average home), then you will be able to become a homeowner faster, since you won’t have to save as much cash.
1 You have $40,000 for a down payment, so you need a $160,000 loan to meet the $200,000 purchase price. 2  So your loan-to-value equation would look like this: $160,000 ÷ $200,000 = .80. 3  You multiply .80 by 100% and that gives you an LTV of 80% . 1 The bank will base the loan amount on the $200,000 figure, because it’s the lower of the 2. 2  You have $40,000 for a down payment, so you need a $160,000 loan to meet the $200,000 purchase price. 3
