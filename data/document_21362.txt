Cancer Overview. Cancer, also called malignancy, is an abnormal growth of cells. There are more than 100 types of cancer, including breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma. Symptoms vary depending on the type. Cancer treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery.
The differences among cancer cells (tumor heterogeneity) is why your pathology report, blood tests, and other tests can be so complicated and why there are so many different treatments for breast cancer. Because the cancer cells can be so different, what kills one type of cell might not do anything to another.
Like other types of cancer, carcinomas are abnormal cells that divide without control. They are able to spread to other parts of the body, but don't always. Carcinoma in situ stays in the cells where it started. Not all cancers are carcinoma.
The type of cancer is generally based on the part of your body and the type of cell where the cancer first developed. The most common places for cancer to develop are the skin, lungs, breasts, prostate, colon and rectum. There are three main types of cell where cancer develops: 1  Epithelial cells. 2  Cancers that develop in this type of cell are called carcinomas. 3  About 80-90% of cancers are this type. 4  Cells of the blood and lymphatic system.
There are three main types of blood cancers: Leukemia, a type of cancer found in your blood and bone marrow, is caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells.
Stem cells in your bone marrow mature and develop into three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. In most blood cancers, the normal blood cell development process is interrupted by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell.
Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They make up about 85 out of every 100 cancers in the UK (85%). There are different types of epithelial cells and these can develop into different types of carcinoma.
