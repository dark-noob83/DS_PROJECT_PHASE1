1 Bring water in pot to boil. 2  Cover pot and steam tamales until dough is firm to touch and separates easily from husk, adding more water to pot as necessary, about 45 minutes. 3  Let stand 10 minutes. ( 4 Can be made 2 days ahead.
1 Steam the tamales in a specified steamer basket. 2  If you have a steamer pot or basket that does not use a stove top for heating, you will need to pour boiling water into the base of the pot and cover with a lid for 1 to 2 hours. 3  Make reference to the instruction manual provided for your particular model to verify.
1 To assemble each tamale, spread 2 tablespoons of the masa mixture on the center of the corn husk (each husk should be 8 inches long and 6 inches wide at the top. 2  If husks are small, overlap 2 small ones to form one. 3  If it is large, tear a strip from the side).
Fill a Dutch oven with 1 Â½ to 2 inches of water. Bring the water to boil on the stove. Place a steamer basket in the Dutch oven. Place the tamales in the basket so that the folded husk rests against the seam side of the tamale and steam them, and then place the lid on the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat so that the water simmers. Steam refrigerated tamales for 15 to 20 minutes and frozen tamales for 20 to 35 minutes. Check often to make sure that the water does not boil away. The tamales are cooked thoroughly when the husk separates from the dough, and they are no longer sticky.
1 Pack the pot in which the tamales are being steamed with additional corn husks to improve the flavor. 2  Place a towel over the tamales while steaming to catch and absorb the moisture that builds up under the lid. 3  Double-wrap the tamales in corn husk so the masa doesn't come in contact with the boiling water.
Steam the cooking tamales for approximately 1 to 2 hours. Take off the lid and check the level of the water every 15 minutes. Do not let the water run dry. Refill with water from a pitcher, as necessary.
