Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the liver, heart, and other parts of the body. One of the major features of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. These ducts carry bile (which helps to digest fats) from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine.

DONATE NOW. Alagille syndrome is an inherited disorder that mimics other forms of prolonged liver disease seen in infants and young children. However, a group of unusual features in other organ systems distinguishes Alagille syndrome from other liver and bile duct diseases in infants.
Alagille syndrome is a genetic condition that usually presents with symptoms from multiple organs, particularly the liver. This article will cover the causes, risk factors, symptoms, lab tests, and treatment of alagille syndrome.
Alagille syndrome is the name given to a particular type of liver condition called biliary hypoplasia in association with at least two other signs in other parts of the body. It affects approximately one in every 100,000 live births and occurs equally between boys and girls.
