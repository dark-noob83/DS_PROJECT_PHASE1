You will have to dig a very large hole to place the pool and this can only be done by a swimming pool professional. On average, the cost of installing a new inground swimming pool runs between $14,961 and $21,649. Choosing a pool installed at the ground level won't require excavation (save $$$).
Pool Price Range. Estimate the cost of your new pool by size or construction style to get an idea of base price. Small pools costs between $20,000 and $30,000, while medium pools are priced between $30,000 and $40,000, according to BobVila.com.
According to P.K. Data the average cost of a 19' diameter above ground swimming pool is $6,243; while the average cost of a 32'x16' inground swimming pool is $21,919.
Small Inground Pool Prices. Small inground swimming pools are generally on the lower end of the cost scale for inground pools. That typically means something less than $50,000 for a fully installed pool. However, a smaller pool offers additional advantages that could reduce the price even further.
Understanding that this is a very rough figure, you can expect to pay $25,000-50,000 for an inground pool. Of course, that’s assuming a pool of average size, in an average city with the average cost of living, average extras, and average materials. Of course, you probably aren’t average.
The two main reasons people decide to get small inground pools are cost and space. Because the cost of an inground pool is mostly determined by its size (length, width, and depth), small inground pool prices are lower than those for larger pools.
Inground vs. Above Ground Pool Costs. The biggest determining factor in the cost of your swimming pool will be whether you choose an inground or above ground option. On average, the cost of installing a new swimming pool runs between $14,961 and $21,649.
