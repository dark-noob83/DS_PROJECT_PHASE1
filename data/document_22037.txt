Roasting breadfruit is typically higher in price. Depending on location, they are between $0.50 and $1.00, and between $0.30 and $0.70 for boiling. One of my favorite breadfruit recipes is baked breadfruit stuffed with ackee and saltfish.
(51, 107) The trunk of the breadfruit tree can attain a diameter of 2feet (60 cm) or more. It is often straight in its lower portion,usually branching at 10–15 feet (3–5 m) above ground level. Itslower branches spread horizontally before curving upward andusually are much longer than the upper branches.
The breadfruit tree can grow 40-60ft tall with a trunk diameter of 1 ½ to two feet. The bark is smooth and light colored and the wood is hard and yellow colored. The leaves are dark-green, leathery, and lobed. They are glossy on the upper side and 1 to three feet long.
The United States Department of Agriculture brought in breadfruit plants from the Canal Zone, Panama, in 1906 (S.P.I. #19228). For many years there have been a number of seedless breadfruit trees in Key West, Florida, and there is now at least one on Vaca Key about 50 miles to the northeast.
Breadfruit is a multipurpose species and all parts of the tree are used. It is an essential component of home gardens and traditional agroforestry systems, creating a lush overstory that shelters a wide range of cultivated and native plants.
A breadfruit tree in its prime productive age of 10–50 years can produce 150–250 fruit or 300–500 lbs/year or more (Ragone 2011). At an average retail price of $2/lb., the 5,000 trees distributed in 2011 are capable of generating $3–5 million dollars in retail sales per year—if the market is properly developed. The current market value of breadfruit is estimated to be a small fraction of this amount.
The breadfruit tree is handsome and fast growing, reaching 85 ft (26 m) in height, often with a clear trunk to 20 ft (6 m) becoming 2 to 6 ft (0.6-1.8 m) in width and often buttressed at the base, though some varieties may never exceed 1/4 or 1/2 of these dimensions.
