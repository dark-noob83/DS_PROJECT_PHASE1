5 years ago. It is different for everyone how long the meds take to work. You should be scheduled for a blood test at about 6 - 8 weeks after starting levothyroxine. At that point your dosage may be adjusted, and then another blood test at 6 - 8 weeks.
Thyroid meds take around 6 weeks to reach full affect. That does not mean you will see an improvement in metabolism or weight in that time. It can take a some time and meds may need to be adjusted before things improve.
Summerâ€¦it can take a long time for the Synthroid to start working. Like say upwards of 3 months. We do tests for thryoid at my job and our patients have to be off their Synthroid for a minimum of 3 weeks before the test can be done. It takes a long time to get in and out of your system.
I was wondering how long it takes before the thyroid medicine starts working. I was diagnosed with Hashi's last week (TSH 65 - under 3 normal, FT4 and T3 under 1, Antibody 600 - normal under 40), and started taking 125 mcg of Synthroid Monday.
Senior Member. It takes 6 weeks to have its full effect. You're doctor should have instructed you to come back for blood work at 6 weeks, then your dose can be adjusted if need be. Be patient, adjusting thyroid meds is a delicate process-and it can take 6 months to a year to get it right. I started on Armour about year ago-I felt better after a couple months-but it did nothing for my weight. 09-22-2013, 01:28 PM #3.
How Well It Works. Antithyroid medicines do not always start working right away. Symptoms usually get better or go away 1 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine. It may take as long as 6 months for your thyroid hormone levels to become normal.
