The anther is the site for synthesis of pollen, the male sex organ in a flower. The pollen grains are transferred from the anther of a male plant to the stigma of a female plant. Thus fertilization takes course.
the anther is on a plant and it is the part of the stamen that contains pollen!!!!!!!!!   that answer is correct i asked my teacher. 8 people found this useful. Edit. Share to: 1  5 Plants That Are Toxic to Cats Flowers and plants can bring beauty to a house or garden.
The pistil is the female part of a flower, consisting of the stigma, style, ovary and ovule. The stigma is the part of the flower that receives the pollen during fertilization. It sits on top of the pistil and is sticky in order to catch the pollen. The style is a tube that extends out the top of the ovary.
Sepal: The outer parts of the flower (often green and leaf-like) that enclose a developing bud. Petal: The parts of a flower that are often conspicuously colored. Stamen: The pollen producing part of a flower, usually with a slender filament supporting the anther. Anther: The part of the stamen where pollen is produced. Pistil: The ovule producing part of a flower.
Pollination is the act of transferring pollen grains from the male anther of a flower to the female stigma. The goal of every living organism, including plants, is to create offspring for the next generation. One of the ways that plants can produce offspring is by making seeds.
If you look inside a typical flower, you will see many small parts. The male reproductive part of a flower is called the stamen. It is composed of a long tube, called a filament, and has a pollen-producing structure on the end. This oval-shaped structure is called the anther. It is crucial in the reproduction of flowering plants, as it produces the male gametophyte, known as pollen.
