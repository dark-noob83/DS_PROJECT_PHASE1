The Three Colonial Regions. The thirteen colonies were British colonies in North America founded between 1607 and 1732. The colonists who came to the New World were not alike, they came from a variety of different social and religious groups who settled in different locations along the Atlantic coast.
The Thirteen Colonies were originally settlements founded for different reasons such as to practice religion freely, earn money from natural resources, as well as have a compl … etely different lifestyle. Over many years settlements turned into colonies and thus the Thirteen Colonies were formed.
The Founding of the American Colonies. The original 13 colonies of America were founded on the eastern coast of what is now the United States between the years of 1607 and 1733. Originally, the colonies belonged to the English, the Dutch, and the Swedish. By the time of the American Revolution, the colonies were all under British control.
Georgia was the last of the 13 colonies. It was founded in 1732, long after the others. James Oglethorpe asked the king for a land charter and was granted an unpopulated portion of land from the Carolina charter called Georgia after King George. Oglethorpe had two motives for making this colony.
