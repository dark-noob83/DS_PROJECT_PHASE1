It depends on the intricacy of design and expertise of the henna artist. For me, a simple palm size design takes 5 to 8 minutes. Henna design on hands of a bride may take anywhere from one hour to two hours. After henna is applied, the paste dries of in 5-10 minutes. We spray lemon and sugar juice to moist the paste again so that it gets good color to the skin. Henna paste is applied in skin just like you are writing in your skin from a marker. The henna paste is like toothpaste (dark brown in color though)

The cost of the kit is similar to the cost of getting it done and you get natural henna from them. You can not get it black like in your picture though with henna. It will be a dark brown. Only a real tattoo or stage makeup can get it black and still be safe. I would like someone to quote me a price for this henna tattoo that I'd like to get on my upper back. (If it helps, I will be getting this done in Ocean City, MD, so the prices may be slightly inflated haha). here's the link to the picture: http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a166/d...

That small amount of henna should cost $6.00 if you have someone else do it for your. You can get a great kit and learn how to do it yourself.http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/kits.ht... YOu can draw on your skin with a child's marker or have another person do it for you. 
Henna tattoos are not expensive and may be done at home. The paste itself is only a few dollars. However, intricate and complex designs can cost about $20-$40 or more depending on the extent of the tattoo. Most artists spend about 1-2 hours designing henna tattoos.
