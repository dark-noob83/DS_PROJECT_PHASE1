The period of a wave is the time for a particle on a medium to make one complete vibrational cycle. Period, being a time, is measured in units of time such as seconds, hours, days or years. The period of orbit for the Earth around the Sun is approximately 365 days; it takes 365 days for the Earth to complete a cycle. Here is an example of a problem with a lot of extraneous information. The period is simply the reciprocal of the frequency. In this case, the period is 1/(51.2 Hz) which is 0.0195 seconds. Know your physics concepts to weed through the extra
Best Answer: The period, T, is the time required for one complete cycle and the unit is seconds. The equation for period is: T=1/frequency The frequency is the number of complete cycles in one second and the unit is Hz or S^-1 So T= 1/25.0Hz, T= 0.04 seconds. Source(s): Jenn26 · 7 years ago. Thumbs up. Find the following values for this wave: a) Period (Hint: frequency is given) b) Speed I know... show more Waves and Vibrations unit in High School Physics course... -Homework question: A wave with an amplitude of 9 cm and a wavelength of 20 cm is traveling in the positive x direction with a frequency of 25.0 Hz.
Frequency is the reciprocal of the period. The period is 5 seconds, so the frequency is 1/(5 s) = 0.20 Hz. 8. A common physics lab involves the study of the oscillations of a pendulum. If a pendulum makes 33 complete back-and-forth cycles of vibration in 11 seconds, then its period is ______. Here is an example of a problem with a lot of extraneous information. The period is simply the reciprocal of the frequency. In this case, the period is 1/(51.2 Hz) which is 0.0195 seconds. Know your physics concepts to weed through the extra
As you might have noticed there is a relationship between the coefficient in front of $$ \theta$$ and the period. In the general formula, this coefficient is typically labelled as 'a'. The general formula for $$ sin(\color{red}{a} \theta)$$ or $$ cos(\color{red}{a} \theta)$$ is. Based on the graph below, what is the period? To solve these problems, just start at the x-axis and look for the first time that the graph returns to that 'height.' So, in this case, we're looking for the time when the graph returns to the -.5 value which is at $$ 2 \pi$$ .
We may also calculate the period using the formula derived from the basic sine and cosine equations. The period for function y = A sin(B x-c) and y = A cos(B x-c) is $\frac{2 \pi}{B}$ radians. The reciprocal of period of a function is equal to its frequency. Frequency is defined as the number of cycles completed in one second. This particular interval is termed as the period of that function.A function f is said to be periodic with period m, if we havef (x + m) = f (x), For every m. It means that the function f(x) possess same values after an interval of m.
For comparison of the approximation to the full solution, consider the period of a pendulum of length 1 m on Earth (g = 9.80665 m/s 2) at initial angle 10 degrees is. The motion is simple harmonic motion where θ 0 is the semi-amplitude of the oscillation (that is, the maximum angle between the rod of the pendulum and the vertical). The period of the motion, the time for a complete oscillation (outward and return) is. which is known as Christiaan Huygens 's law for the period.
This sine curve, y = sin x, has a period of, the horizontal length of one complete cycle. frequency: The frequency of a trigonometric function is the number of cycles it completes in a given interval. This interval is generally radians (or 360) for the sine and cosine curves. 
If a function repeats over at a constant period we say that is a periodic function. Basically it is represented like f(x) = f(x + p), p is the real number and this is the period of the function. Period means the time interval between the two occurrences of the wave. This particular interval is termed as the period of that function.A function f is said to be periodic with period m, if we havef (x + m) = f (x), For every m. It means that the function f(x) possess same values after an interval of m.
