It is much too active and always exists as a compound. The most common calcium compound is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). It occurs as aragonite, calcite, chalk, limestone, marble, and travertine, and in oyster shells and coral. Shellfish build their shells from calcium dissolved in the water.
Calcium does not occur as a free element in nature. It is typically found as a compound and is much too active to be found in its pure form. But, the most common Calcium compound is Calcium Carbonate (limestone, chalk, marble, oyster shells, coral etc).
Calcium Carbonate. Calcium carbonate is a common form of calcium. This form of calcium occurs in over-the-counter stomach antacids such as the brand name called Tums. Taking 500 to 1,000 mg of this type antacid provides a substantial amount of calcium and does not contain shellfish.
Mollusks usually build their shells in a trio of layers. The outermost band, the periostracum, derives mostly from protein, chiefly quinone-tanned protein but also some chitin, which makes up only a very small proportion of the total shell material. The inner layers are calcium-carbonate material.
Calcium Carbonate. The chemical compound calcium carbonate is composed of calcium, carbon and oxygen. A simplified equation for its formation would be the addition of calcium, oxygen and carbon dioxide to form CaCO3, the chemical formula for calcium carbonate. A major source of the compound is marine organisms such as coral, shellfish and mollusks, which use it to construct their shells, or skeleton-like casing.
Why exoskeletons of snails and clams are calcium carbonate while the endoskeleton of vertebrates like turtles are primarily calcium phosphate is not known. Both shells are strong, allow for protection, attachment of muscles and resist dissolution in water. Evolution works in mysterious ways.
