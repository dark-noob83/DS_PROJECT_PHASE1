Percent of Calories. According to the Institute of Medicine, children and adults should consume 45 to 65 percent of their calorie intake as carbohydrates, and at least 130 grams of carbs per day. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.

You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label.
Grams of Carbs. Determine the number of grams of carbs you need each day by calculating 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake, and dividing by 4. For example, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, shoot for 225 to 325 grams of carbs per day; and if you eat 2,500 calories a day, aim for 281 to 406 grams of carbs.

To figure out how many fat grams or calories that means for you, start with the number of calories you normally eat or want to eat a day. Multiply that number by the recommended percentages to get the range of fat calories you can eat each day. Here's an example based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. 1  Multiply 2,000 by 0.20 (20 percent) to get 400 calories. So if you're on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, 400 to 700 calories can come from dietary fat, which translates to between 44 and 78 fat grams a day. Use the Nutrition Facts label to find out how much fat is in the foods you eat.
1 The amount of fat you should eat each day is between 25% and 35% of your total calories. 2  If you eat 2,000 calories each day, that means you would need around 600 calories from fat. 3  Solid fats because they have saturated and trans fats. % Daily Value top. 1  For your health, experts recommend that you get certain amount of different nutrients daily. 2  The % Daily Value (%DV) tells you what percentage of the daily recommendation you get from one serving of a food. 3  The %DV is based on eating 2,000 calories each day.
A person who eats 2,000 calories per day should eat 6 ounces of grain foods daily. At least half (3 ounces) of the grain foods eaten should be whole grains. Approximately one ounce of grain foods counts as a serving. This is about one slice of bread, one roll, or one small muffin. A person who consumes 2,000 calories daily should eat about 5Â½ ounces of protein each day. You can get protein from seafood, lean meat and poultry, as well as eggs, beans and peas, tofu, nuts, and seeds.
So if you eat 2,100 calories per day or about 700 calories at each meal, about 350 to 420 calories per meal should come from carbs. One slice of whole-wheat bread has about 14 grams of carbs, and a large banana has 31 grams. According to the Institute of Medicine, adult women need about 46 grams of protein per day, and adult men need about 56 grams, which breaks down to 15 to 19 grams of protein per meal if you eat three meals a day.
