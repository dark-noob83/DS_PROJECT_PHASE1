Best Answer: It takes 27.3 days for the moon to encircle Earth, but 29.5 days for it to return to the same spot in the sky relative to the sun [back to the same moon phase]. the moon's phases take 29.5 days to complete one cycle, but that is made longer because of the Earth's orbit of the Sun. The real time it take to make one orbit of the Earth is 27.3 days. Kyle M · 7 years ago.
The orbit of the Moon around the Earth is not an easy process. The Moon makes a complete orbit around the Earth approximately once every 28 days. This means that the Moon orbits the Earth around 13 times in a year.

The moon orbits the earth in a little under 28 earth days. It travels at almost 2,290 miles per hour. Coincidentally, the moon's rotation period is also a little under 28 days, meaning the same face points toward the earth during its entire orbit. The English word month is derived from moonth, which was how long the moon was observed to take to return to a specific phase. 1 An anomalistic month is the Moon's orbital period measured from perigee to perigee-the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to Earth. 2  An anomalistic month is about 27.55 days on average.
Not to be confused with Lunar orbit (the orbit of an object around the Moon). The Moon orbits Earth in the prograde direction and completes one revolution in approximately 27.322 days (a sidereal month). Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about 4600 km from Earth's center (about three quarters of the radius of Earth). On average, the Moon is at a distance of about 385000 km from Earth's center, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of 1.023 km/s, the Moon moves relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about 0.5°.
The 'dark' side of the moon. The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this sychronous rotation. 
How long does it take our Moon to go around Earth? It takes 27 days, 7 hours, and 43 minutes for our Moon to complete one full orbit around Earth. This is called the sidereal month, and is measured by our Moon's position relative to distant fixed stars. However, it takes our Moon about 29.5 days to complete one cycle of phases (from new Moon to new Moon).
The orbit of the Moon around the Earth is completed in approximately 27.32 days. The more precise figure is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds. The period between cons … ecutive phases is longer, at 29.53 days, because the position of the Earth and Moon changes as Earth orbits around the Sun. 1 An anomalistic month is the Moon's orbital period measured from perigee to perigee-the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to Earth. 2  An anomalistic month is about 27.55 days on average.
The Moon makes a complete orbit around the Earth every 27.3 days (the orbital period), and the periodic variations in the geometry of the Earth–Moon–Sun system are responsible for the lunar phases that repeat every 29.5 days. the moon's phases take 29.5 days to complete one cycle, but that is made longer because of the Earth's orbit of the Sun. The real time it take to make one orbit of the Earth is 27.3 days. Kyle M · 7 years ago.
How long does it take the Moon to orbit the Earth? The Moon takes about 27 days (27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds) to go all the way around the Earth and return to its starting position. The Moon's orbit around the Earth is a slightly squashed circle called an ellipse. A lunar month is about 29.5 days (29 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds). Why is a Lunar month (29.5 days) longer than the number of days it takes the Moon to orbit the Earth (27.3)? Whilst the Moon is orbiting the Earth, the Earth is constantly moving because it is orbiting the sun.
