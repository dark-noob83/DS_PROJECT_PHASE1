Confidence votes 105. Igneous rocks are rocks that have been formed from the cooling of flowing magma from a volcano or crack in the earth with lava beneath it. Igenous may or may not form crystals in there composition, and most of the rocks are from the mantle or the lower crust.
yes, it does. when a grain size in an igneous rock is small, it means that it was probably an extrusive rock, meaning it formed on land. but if the grain size is big, it means â€¦ that the rock most likely formed underground, or it was intrusive.
Igneous means fiery, and igneous rocks are rocks that were made by heating them up in a fire. Usually that fire is the big fire inside the earth, under the earth's crust. Inside the earth, radioactivity creates very high temperatures of about 1000 degrees Celsius (that's about 1800 degrees Fahrenheit).
An igneous rock is one formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Examples include basalt, rhyolite, pumice, scoria, granite, diorite, gabbro, and obsidian.
Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rock may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust.
Extrusive igneous rock is one of two different types of igneous rocks. The other kind is intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rock is formed when magma in Earth's lithosphere cools and hardens. Extrusive igneous rock is formed when lava on Earth's surfac
An Igneous rock is the product of cooled solidified magma/lava. As magma/lava cools it goes through the process of crystallization which turns it into an igneous rock. The amount of time it takes for an igneous rock to form depends on its location and its composition.
