Side Effects and Interactions. Nasal irritation and burning may sometimes accompany the use of Flonase. Other side effects may include sneezing, sore throat, nosebleeds, runny nose, nasal congestion, sinusitis, nasal dryness, or unpleasant taste.
Do not swallow Flonase. Because the nose and throat are closely related, nasal sprays can sometimes drip into the back of your mouth or throat. Flonase is not meant to be swallowed, though, and this may cause unwanted side effects.
