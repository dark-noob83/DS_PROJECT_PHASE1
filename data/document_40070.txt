Answer by Ravyn (114). BPM (beats per minute) is the pace of music measured by the number of beats that occur in 60 seconds. The tempo of most music ranges from 10 bpm (very, very slow) to just over 200 bpm (very, very fast). The average tempo of all music is roughly 120 bpm. There is no real average as the bpm varies greatly on the type of music. Rock music temds to be at about 120 (BPM), and a slow waltz 90. House music is faster than Rock, around 120-128 bpm, Jungle still faster at 150-180 bpm.
Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention.
You can tell how fast your heart is beating (your heart rate) by feeling your pulse. Your heart-rate is the amount of times your heart beats in one minute. You will need a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers.
The answer, as we've seen before, is in the music's BPM (beats per minute). This chart helps you find the right BPM to look for in a song depending on how you run. Previously we've noted that the best exercise music is between 120-140 BPM, but the right range for you may actually depend on what type of exercise you do and personal factors like your stride length.
What counts as an abnormally slow heartbeat for one person may not be the same for another. For example, a young, strong, healthy athlete may have a resting heart rate of 30-40 beats per minute, but may easily increase his heart rate to 180 beats per minute with exercise. This is normal. 1 Tachy-brady syndrome– It is possible for the same person to have a slow heartbeat when the heart is in normal rhythm and periods of fast, irregular heartbeats (supraventricular tachycardias) at other times. 2  Sometimes, medications needed to control the fast heart rate can worsen the already slow heart rate.

House music is faster than Rock, around 120-128 bpm, Jungle still faster at 150-180 bpm. In the 40s and 50s, fast Bebop had high bpm, with some performed at 380 BPM
Slow Heartbeat. Slow heartbeat (heart rate), called bradycardia, is an arrhythmia, or disorder of the heart’s rhythm. Each day, a normal heart beats about 100,000 times, at a rate any­where from 60 to 100 times a minute. Changes in heart rate caused by activity, diet, medications, and age are normal and common. 1 Tachy-brady syndrome– It is possible for the same person to have a slow heartbeat when the heart is in normal rhythm and periods of fast, irregular heartbeats (supraventricular tachycardias) at other times. 2  Sometimes, medications needed to control the fast heart rate can worsen the already slow heart rate.
How fast the heart beats depends on the body's need for oxygen-rich blood. At rest, the SA node causes your heart to beat about 50 to 100 times each minute. During activity or excitement, your body needs more oxygen-rich blood; the heart rate rises to well over 100 beats per minute. Your heart-rate is the amount of times your heart beats in one minute. You will need a watch with a second hand. Place your index and middle finger of your hand on the inner wrist of the other arm, just below the base of the thumb. You should feel a tapping or pulsing against your fingers.
Beats per minute (BPM) is a unit typically used as a measure of tempo in music and heart rate. The BPM tempo of a piece of music is conventionally shown in its score as a metronome mark, as illustrated to the right. This indicates that every one minute there should be 120 quarter notes (or crotchets). For example, a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second, while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid, signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds.
The normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40–50 BPM is common and is considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. These abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease. Normal resting heart rates range from 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention.
