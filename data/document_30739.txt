In Rules, Durkheim delineates two different classes of social facts. The first class concerns social facts of a physiological, or operative, order. This set of social facts includes a society’s legal code, religious beliefs, concept of beauty, monetary system, ways of dressing, or its language.

This description and explanation of the most primitive religion, however, was only the primary purpose of The Elementary Forms; and its secondary purpose was by far the most ambitious of Durkheim's attempts to provide sociological answers to philosophical questions.
