It depends on how long you were on Depo and how your body reacted to it, and possibly some other factor we're not aware of. It can take up to 18 months for the effects of Depo to fully wear off, but some women bounce right back within a month after when you were due for your shot.

Best Answer: it could take anywhere from 12-18 months to get the Depo completely out of your system and start having regular periods.
Yes | No Thank you! I was on the Depo shot for 4 years when I decided I wanted another baby. I was told it would take 1 year to 18 months after stopping to get pregnant. My last injection of Depo was in April 2005 which wore off 12 weeks later.
Report Abuse. It can take up too 2 years for depo to completely leave your system after your last shot. A friend of mine had her last shot 18 months ago and is still trying to get pregnant.

The DEPO will stay in your system for 3 months but you can become pregnant and conceive, before the 3 month time frame is up. One in a 100 women getting a Depo shot every 12 weeks will get pregnant in a year. After stopping it takes on average a further 9-10 months to get pregnant.
