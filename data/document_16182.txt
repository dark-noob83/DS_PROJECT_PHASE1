Comments. Robert Gordon Bobby Orr born March 20, 1948 is considered one of the greatest players to ever play in the NHL. Orr played 10 seasons for the Boston Bruins and a brief two years with the Chicago Black Hawks although he didn't play much for the Blackhawks seeing as he was injured for most of his time there. Bobby Orr began his NHL career in Boston in 1966.
2008-10-08 16:21:00. It's hard not to wince watching Bobby Orr's latest TV commercial, which highlights the many scars on his knees from the injuries that shortened his Hall of Fame hockey career.
He had 14 knee surgeries and he still played hockey even though it was very painful. Bobby was only in the N.H.L until he was 30. Bobby was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks just two years before he retired. Bobby was forced to retire because of the pain in his knees.
Bobby Orr pulls up his left pant leg revealing the most famous knee in hockey. Maybe the most famous knee on the planet, a knee that by his count — and he does not have an exact count because he can’t access all his medical records — was operated on at least 17 times and perhaps as many as 21.
It is to begin airing later this month on television and on the scoreboard screens in Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver. Orr had surgery on his knees more than a dozen times in his career, which began in 1967 in Boston and ended with only 26 games played over three seasons with Chicago in the late 1970s. He was considered the greatest player of his era and a prototype of the rushing defenceman that is now common in the NHL.
The Parry Sound, Ont., native is the only defenceman to win a scoring title, in 1969-70 and 1974-75, was league MVP three times and won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenceman eight straight years from 1968 to 1975.
Bobby Orr is recognized today as the most dominating Junior hockey player in history. At 14 years old, he played hockey against 19 and 20 year old players, and he was a star. Orr had four all-star seasons in Oshawa, but never won the Memorial Cup.
