2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years and 4 years. That's the schedule. AS far as autism goes, I have worked with children with autism for 10 years, and there is no credible study that shows any type of link. I know children with autism who have not had the shots. A lot of times doctors will give the baby their first shot while they're in the hospital, but you can sign a form to delay this until their first check-up. They get their first check-up at 2 weeks old and they get shots at that time. Lisa · 6 years ago. Thumbs up.
