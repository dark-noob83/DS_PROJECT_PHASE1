What are the steps in muscle contraction. 1. Efferent motor cortex axons synapse on the spinal cord and generate an action potential in the α-motor neuron. 2. The action potential travels to the axon terminal, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. 3. Acetylcholine binds a receptor on the skeletal muscle cell and generates an action potential, increasing Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 4. Ca++ initiates contraction, resulting in shortening of the muscle cell and, consequently, movement
Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: length and tension. A muscle contraction is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same.
This calcium then binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to move and allowing cross-bridges to form between the myosin and actin filaments. The actin is then pulled (slides) across the myosin. Unlike skeletal muscle, there is no neuromuscular junction or troponin in smooth muscle. Instead, contraction is started by the release of neurotransmitter vesicles (membrane bound containers) into the space between the cells. In smooth muscle calcium acts directly on the myosin head-causing cross-bridges to form.
Contraction in skeletal muscle begins with a nerve impulse-acetlycholine is released at the neuromuscular junction and binds to receptors in the muscle. This causes the rele … ase of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Instead, contraction is started by the release of neurotransmitter vesicles (membrane bound containers) into the space between the cells. In smooth muscle calcium acts directly on the myosin head-causing cross-bridges to form.
The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between the delay in initiation and termination of muscle contraction and clinical measures of motor impairment and physical disability in the affected upper limb of patients with hemiparesis. However, the delay was not significantly affected by stroke type, stroke level, side of hemiparesis, or presence of aphasia. Delay in initiation and termination of muscle contraction correlated significantly with FMA and AMAT.

to contraction in skeletal muscle. The trigger for a muscle contraction is an electrical impulse. The electrical signal sets off a series of events that lead to crossbridge cycling between myosin and actin, which generates force. The series of events is slightly different between skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle. 
A muscle cell remains contracted until the release of acetylcholine stops and an enzyme produced at the axon terminal destroys any remaining acetylcholine .. Instead, contraction is started by the release of neurotransmitter vesicles (membrane bound containers) into the space between the cells. In smooth muscle calcium acts directly on the myosin head-causing cross-bridges to form.
The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: length and tension. A muscle contraction is described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same. In contrast, a muscle contraction is isotonic if muscle length changes but the muscle tension remains the sam
(2) A motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord is activated, and an action potential passes outward in a ventral root of the spinal cord. (3) The axon branches to supply a number of muscle fibers called a motor unit, and the action potential is conveyed to a motor end plate on each muscle fiber. The following steps are involved in muscle contraction: (1) The sequence of events leading to contraction is initiated somewhere in the central nervous system, either as voluntary activity from the brain or as reflex activity from
