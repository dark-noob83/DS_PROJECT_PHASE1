Pure gold is soft and is usually alloyed with other metals, such as silver, copper, platinum or palladium, to increase its strength. Gold alloys are used to make jewelry, decorative items, dental fillings and coins. The amount of gold in an alloy is measured with a unit called a karat. Gold is the most malleable and ductile of all known metals. A single ounce of gold can be beaten into a sheet measuring roughly 5 meters on a side. Thin sheets of gold, known as gold leaf, are primarily used in arts and crafts for gilding.
Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. Gold's most stable isomer is 198m2 Au with a half-life of 2.27 days. Gold's least stable isomer is 177m2 Au with a half-life of only 7 ns. 184m1 Au has three decay paths: β + decay, isomeric transition, and alpha decay. No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths.
If this stamp is present, it will indicate how much pure gold is in the jewelry. For instance, the minimum amount in order to be considered gold-filled is 20 percent. This item would have a stamp that looks like 1/20. You may also see 1/50, which would indicate that the item is 50 percent pure gold. Gold-filled jewelry is much more valuable than gold-plated. In fact, there is almost 100 percent more gold in gold-filled items than is found in gold-plated items. Just as gold-plated jewelry is plated with gold, gold-filled jewelry is as well, but there is a big difference between the ways these products are made.

Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from the Latin aurum, meaning shining dawn) and atomic number 79. It is a highly sought-after precious metal which, for many centuries, has been used as money, a store of value and in jewelry. 
1 Gold is used as an input in products. 2  Since gold is used in the production of various products including jewelry and electronics, there is a reliable demand that further stabilizes the price of gold. 3  Moreover, in times of increased demand, these markets can force the price of gold higher. While gold can be a great investment for a number of reasons outlined above, be aware of the disadvantages before investing: 1  Gold doesn’t earn passive income. 2  Other investments such as stocks and bonds may derive a portion of their value from passive income in the form of interest and dividends.
Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity and does not tarnish when it is exposed to the air, so it can be used to make electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. Gold is also a good reflector of infrared radiation and can be used to help shield spacecraft and skyscrapers from the sun's heat. Gold is the most malleable and ductile of all known metals. A single ounce of gold can be beaten into a sheet measuring roughly 5 meters on a side. Thin sheets of gold, known as gold leaf, are primarily used in arts and crafts for gilding.
In popular culture gold has many connotations but is most generally connected to terms such as good or great, such as in the phrases: has a heart of gold, that's golden!, golden moment, then you're golden! and golden boy. It remains a cultural symbol of wealth and through that, in many societies, success. Gold's most stable isomer is 198m2 Au with a half-life of 2.27 days. Gold's least stable isomer is 177m2 Au with a half-life of only 7 ns. 184m1 Au has three decay paths: β + decay, isomeric transition, and alpha decay. No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths.
1 Gold rises in value when inflation takes hold. 2  Since gold is priced in U.S. dollars, any deterioration in the dollar will logically lead to a higher price of gold. 3  As a result, during inflationary times, gold offers a much more stable investment than cash. While gold can be a great investment for a number of reasons outlined above, be aware of the disadvantages before investing: 1  Gold doesn’t earn passive income. 2  Other investments such as stocks and bonds may derive a portion of their value from passive income in the form of interest and dividends.
White gold is an alloy of gold and some white metals such as silver and palladium. Traditionally nickel was used in white gold, however, nickel is no longer used in most white gold made today as nickel can cause reactions with some people. These jewelry items are sometimes called two-tone, three-tone or multi-colored gold. The gold content of yellow gold is measured in the same way it is measured in for example white gold. So an 18ct white gold ring contains 75% pure gold, just as 18ct yellow gold contains 75% pure gold.
