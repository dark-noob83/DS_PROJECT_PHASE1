When you plan to make moonshine at home, it is just as important to buy alcohol measuring equipment and accessories as it is to buy pot stills and distillation columns.
Distilling moonshine involves a lot of processes and different materials such as a still. Without this equipment, making quality moonshine is almost impossible. Yet, many individuals are still not certain as to how this thing woks and how does it affect the beverage they are making.
So distilling moonshine is a two step process, step one ferment some sugars to make alcohol and step two distill it to remove unwanted byproducts such as methanol and increase the concentration of the alcohol.
However, if you have a solution that is 50% ethanol and 50% water, the boiling temperature will be significantly higher. In fact, in a 50/50 solution of ethanol and water, the boiling (liquid) temperature of ethanol will be about 180 degrees.

When this stops it means that the mash is ready. Distill moonshine at home with the right equipment. The still is important in the process. Take the pressure cooker and make a 1/4‚Äù hole in the lid. Take copper tubing and put it in the hole so that it is just an inch in the pot.
If you measure liquid temperature while distilling, you may have noticed that liquid temp can often be much higher than 174 before a still starts producing. Again, the boiling temperature of a solution that is 100% ethanol is 174 degrees.
The basic ingredients needed to distill moonshine are sugar, water, corn meal, yeast and malt extract. The equipment needed are a Tub for the mash, a fermenter, a still and a condenser.
