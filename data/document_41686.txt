Creatine kinase (CK or CPK) is an enzyme (a type of protein) found in muscle and brain. Normally, very little CK is found circulating in the blood. Elevated levels indicate damage to either muscle or brain; possibly from a myocardial infarction (heart attack), muscle disease, or stroke.
This blood test measures an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK) or creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Enzymes are chemicals that help the cells of your body work. Muscle cells make the creatine kinase enzyme.
The Test. A creatine kinase (CK) test may be used to detect inflammation of muscles (myositis) or serious muscle damage and/or to diagnose rhabdomyolysis if a person has signs and symptoms, such as muscle weakness, muscle aches, and dark urine.
The creatine phosphokinase test measures the amount of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) present in the blood. The test is also known as creatine kinase, CPK test, and CK test. Creatine phosphokinase is a specific enzyme found primarily in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. The creatine phosphokinase test is performed to assess damage to tissue in the brain, muscle tissue, or heart.
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is an enzyme found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. This article discusses the test to measure the amount of CPK in the blood.
Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK). Creatine phosphokinase (a.k.a., creatine kinase, CPK, or CK) is an enzyme (a protein that helps to elicit chemical changes in your body) found in your heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. When muscle tissue is damaged, CPK leaks into your blood.
Creatine kinase or creatine phosphokinase is an enzyme chiefly found in the brain, skeletal muscles, and heart.
