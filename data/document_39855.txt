What is the Normal Size of the Thyroid Gland. The normal size, or range of size, of the thyroid gland in adults is 4 to 4.8 cm x 1.0 to 1.8 cm x 0.8 to1.6 cm. As mentioned above, the thyroid gland is one of the largest endocrine glands found in humans. The weight of this gland in neonates is about 2-3 grams. In case of adults, the normal weight of the thyroid gland should be in between 18-20 grams. The size of the thyroid gland can increase due to certain conditions like pregnancy or smoking frequently. These conditions are not termed as abnormal.
Answer by Riley (765). A normal thyroid is when the right lobe measures 5x1. 8 x 2. 0 cm. and the left lobe measures 4. 0 x1. 5x 1. 4cm. The usual way of measuring the thyroid is by having an ultra-sound. If one or both lobes are large you need a Fine Needle Aspiration. 
Normal Size Range. According to endocrinologist Dr. Mark Lupo, normal dimensions for the thyroid gland are 4 to 4.8 x 1.0 to 1.8 x 0.8 to1.6 cm. However, dimensions that fall outside of this range do not necessarily signify abnormal pathology.
