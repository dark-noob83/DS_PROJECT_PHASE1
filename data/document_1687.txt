Tc = (5/9)*(Tf-32); Tc = temperature in degrees Celsius, Tf = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. For example, suppose you have a Fahrenheit temperature of 98.6 degrees and you wanted to convert it into degrees on the Celsius scale. Using the above formula, you would first subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature and get 66.6 as a result. Then you multiply 66.6 by five-ninths and get the converted value of 37 degrees Celsius. Below is the formula to convert a Celsius scale temperature into degrees on the Fahrenheit scale.
How to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. The temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (C) times 9/5 plus 32: T (F) = T (C) × 9/5 + 32.
Another simple conversion method from C to F is to double the celsius, subtract 10%, add 32. For example: 100C = 2x100=200,200-20=180,add 32=212F. More about fahrenheit and celsius. Visit the Canadian holidays 2015 website for dates and info about holidays in Canada to help plan your vacations.
How to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. The temperature T in degrees Celsius (C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (F) minus 32, times 5/9: T (C) = (T (F) - 32) × 5/9. or.
1 A 1 Celsius change is a change of 1.8 Fahrenheits while a 1 Fahrenheit change translates to a change of 0.55 Celsius. 2  This is one of the easiest way to convert them if you know that 0 C = 32 F. 3  100 F is really really hot in the summer and it is 38 C so when people talk about a 100 F heatwave, it means hot.
Tf = (9/5)*Tc+32; Tc = temperature in degrees Celsius, Tf = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Assume that you have a Celsius scale temperature of 100 degrees and you wish to convert it into degrees on the Fahrenheit scale.
The temperature T in degrees Celsius (C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (F) minus 32, times 5/9: T (C) = (T (F) - 32) × 5/9. or.
