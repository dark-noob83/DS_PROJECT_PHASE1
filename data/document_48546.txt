3. Set command block actions. In the text box at the top of the menu, type in a command in the same way you would in the chat box. The command block functions just like the chat; however, it can be attached to a button or a circuit to execute commands automatically.
To get a command block you need to enable cheats, then type /give 137. To use the command block set it down and righty click on it, when you do this a screen will pop up. Type â€¦ whatever command you want it to perform here. Now every time you power the command block, it will perform its set command.
Okay, for step one you need to get the command blocks in your inventory. Make sure you have cheats ON and say /give (player name) command_block. After you get in in your inventory place 5 in a row. Then you right click the first one and put the command /give @a 306. Then exit out of that command block and right click the next one.
Also worth learning is that the code you write in the command console (when you press the t key), is the same code that is used by a command block. So you can right click a command block and type: /give @p diamond 64. Then, add any random block directly next to the command block and add a button. When that button is pressed the player will get 64 diamonds. You can also use handy codes like these for a command block: / 1 set time 0 (sets the time to early morning).
To enter or modify the command in a command block, use the Use Item control on the command block to open the command block GUI (graphical user interface). The GUI will only open if the player is in creative mode, and has the proper permissions. In singleplayer, cheats must be enabled to edit command blocks.
