Monera are considered as the most primitive group of organisms. They include various types of bacteria and blue-green algae. Monerans are most abundant of all organisms, due to their versa ti lity of their habitat. It is estimated that a single drop of water contai ns 50 billion bacteria. 1 They are primitive organisms. 2  All organisms of the kingdom are prokaryotes. 3  They are present in both living and non-living environment. 4  They can survive in harsh and extreme climatic conditions like in hot springs, acidic soils etc.
After an in-depth study of the characteristics of Monera kingdom, it was divided into two groups archaea and bacteria. This classification of living beings was under the three-domain system of taxonomy that was established in 1991. The third domain included the Eukaryote group. 1 The source of nutrition for these organisms is usually photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. 2  The characteristics also include the shape of the cell that includes round (cocci), rod-like (bacilli), or spiral (spirochetes or spirilla).

The following points related to Monera characteristics will help you understand the kingdom of classification better. Monera are about 1 micrometer in size and complex as living molecules.
The Kingdom Monera is the most numerous of all organisms, and makes up the only prokaryotic kingdom. All of the Monerans share these characteristics: Quick Fact: Monera is derived from the Greek word moneres, meaning single, in reference to the single-celled nature of most prokaryotes. - All bacteria are prokaryotes. - Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, which is asexual. - 1  Reproduction (How organisms in Kingdom Monera reproduce). - 2  Methods of Movement (How these organisms move). - 3  Defence (Methods the monerans have to defend against other organisms and harsh enviroments).
Under the three-domain system of taxonomy, introduced by Carl Woese in 1977, which reflects the evolutionary history of life, the organisms found in kingdom Monera have been divided into two domains, Archaea and Bacteria (with Eukarya as the third domain). Monera (/məˈnɪərə/ mə-NEER-ə) is a kingdom that contains unicellular organisms with a prokaryotic cell organization (having no nuclear membrane), such as bacteria. The taxon Monera was first proposed as a phylum by Ernst Haeckel in 1866.
General characteristics of the kingdom Monera are as follows: They are primitive organisms. All organisms of the kingdom are prokaryotes. They are present in both living and non-living environment. They can survive in harsh and extreme climatic conditions like in hot springs, acidic soils etc. 1 They are primitive organisms. 2  All organisms of the kingdom are prokaryotes. 3  They are present in both living and non-living environment. 4 
All organisms that fall into the Moneran kingdom are considered prokaryotes. They are the simplest and earliest life forms on the planet. Bacteria are part of the Moneran kingdom. All members of the kingdom Monera have no nuclei in their cells. All genetic material in these cell floats around in the cytoplasm. They have plasmid DNA. Monerans reproduce both sexually and asexually. digest their food outside of the cell and then absorb the nutrient
Kingdom Monera Characteristics.

The kingdom is divided into two groups Archaebacteria and Eubacteria. All the organisms of this kingdom are prokaryotes. These cells do not have nuclear membrane, the chromosome is a single and circular, they also lack membrane bound cellular organelles. This kingdom includes bacteria, cyanobacteria, mycoplasma etc. 1 They are primitive organisms. 2  All organisms of the kingdom are prokaryotes. 3  They are present in both living and non-living environment. 4  They can survive in harsh and extreme climatic conditions like in hot springs, acidic soils etc.
