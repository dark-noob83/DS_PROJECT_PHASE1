Prominent copper sulfide minerals include Cu 2 S (chalcocite) and CuS (covellite). In the mining industry, the minerals bornite or chalcopyrite, which consist of mixed copper-iron sulfides, are often referred to as copper sulfides. In chemistry, a binary copper sulfide is any binary chemical compound of the elements copper and sulfur. Whatever their source, copper sulfides vary widely in composition with 0.5 ≤ Cu/S ≤ 2, including numerous non-stoichiometric compounds.
In this issue: copper sulfide. This demonstration involves some fantastic chemistry and makes an excellent introduction to the use of quantitative calculations to find the formula of a reaction product, copper sulfide. Students will also get the chance to see some of the allotropes of sulfur.
Copper sulfate is an inorganic compound that combines sulfur with copper. It can kill bacteria, algae, roots, plants, snails, and fungi. The toxicity of copper sulfate depends on the copper content.
EXPERIMENT 3 THE SYNTHESIS OF COPPER SULFIDE When heated together, copper and sulfur combine to form a sulfide of copper. In thisassignment, you will heat a known mass of copper with excess sulfur in a covered crucible toproduce the nonvolatile copper sulfide.
Apart from the above uses of copper sulfate, this compound is also used in preparation of wood preservatives to protect timber from wood worms. It is also utilized as a mordant in dyeing, and as a reagent in tanning process.
Copper sulfate is a chemical compound which is produced commercially by reacting various copper(II) compounds with sulfuric acid. This compound is used in a wide range of industries, from pyrotechnics to viticulture.
