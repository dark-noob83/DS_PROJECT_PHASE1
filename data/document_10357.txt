PA. Photo: PA. Sylvester Stallone is set to play Rocky Balboa for the seventh time in a forthcoming spin-off film called Creed. The spin-off will focus on the grandson of Apollo Creed, Balboa's friend and longtime boxing rival played by Carl Weathers, who was killed in the ring in Rocky VI.
Posted on Wednesday, February 25th, 2015 by Russ Fischer. Creed sounds like a great way to structure a new chapter in the very long-running Rocky saga. For this film, Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky, but he’s not the central figure.
Creed is an upcoming American sports drama film written and directed by Ryan Coogler, co-written by Aaron Covington and produced by Sylvester Stallone, who also co-stars. The film features Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Tony Bellew and Graham McTavish. It is a spin-off from the Rocky film series.
A new entry into the Rocky series has finally begun moving forward. Creed, directed by and starring the Fruitvale Station team of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan, has been in-development for over a year. It’ll star Jordan as the grandson of Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the nemesis/friend of Rocky Balboa who died in Rocky IV. He’s an up and coming boxer and asks his dad’s old friend Rocky (Sylvester Stallone, reprising his iconic role) for help.
Creed will be co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler, whose debut movie Fruitvale Station-which also stars Michael B Jordan-won the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Stallone is said to love the premise of the spin-off movie and will serve as a producer as well as appearing on screen.
“Rocky” fans are flying high now that word has leaked that a spinoff movie is in the works. MGM has greenlit “Creed,” focusing on the grandson of Rocky nemesis turned friend Apollo Creed, who was played by Carl Weathers in the first four “Rocky” films, Deadline.com reported.
