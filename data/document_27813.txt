Laying eggs. Parakeet egg laying will start in about one or two days after the mating. Female parakeet will lay an egg every second day and there will be approximately 4 to 9 of them. Once the female has laid the eggs you might choose to keep all or remove some of them.
While waiting for eggs to hatch, only the female will sit on them. She will do that for about 18 to 19 days when the first bird should hatch. The eggs need to be in a temperature close to the body temperature of the mommy parakeet. That would be 40 to 43 degrees Celsius (104 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit).
