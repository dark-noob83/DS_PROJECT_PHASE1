The question of whether or not to supplement a horse with vitamins, minerals, herbs, enzymes, amino acids or nutraceuticals will be asked and answered 100,000 times today. The answer in 99,999 cases will be accepted or rejected strictly on whether or not it was the answer the person asking wanted to hear.
Minerals. As with vitamins, the majority of your horse's mineral needs are met with a basic ration of pasture and hay. In some instances, the ratio between two minerals is as important as the actual amount available, because one might influence absorption or activity of another.
Overview. Vitamins and minerals are often added to a grain mix to ensure it is balanced and meets a horse’s minimal nutritional requirements. A vitamin and mineral premix should be specific for the classification of horse.
There are several nutrients a horse requires such as water, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Specific amounts for each of these nutrients will depend largely on your horse’s weight and activity level or physiologic status (such as if an animal is growing or lactating).
Vitamins are organic compounds that are needed in even smaller quantities than minerals by the horse, although no less critical. Vitamins can be divided into two groups, the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and the water soluble C and B-complex vitamins.
If you are using a grain mix that already includes vitamins and minerals specifically for your horse’s age, workload, and production status, then you shouldn’t need to top-dress with additional vitamins and minerals.
Vitamin and mineral nutrition of the horse. Marcia Hathaway, PhD. Department of Animal Science, University of Minnesota. Minerals are inorganic nutrients that are needed in relatively small quantities by the horse. The essential major minerals are calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, chloride, potassium and sulfur. The essential trace minerals needed are iron, zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, iodine, and cobalt.
