Average cost per acre treated was $13.25 with a range of $9.60 to $16.90 per acre. Brush Busters also has a program specifically targeting prickly pear. The program promotes only one select herbicide treatment: a pad or stem spray containing one percent Picloram and five percent diesel fuel.
Again I assume for the same reason that this is an installed price and that the materials are containerized. This is a cost of $2,670.00 per acre for reclaimed wetlands. Our tree planting costs for forested wetlands average approximately $1.25 each or $1,875.00 per acre (1500/ac). However, our average costs for upland plantings (600/ac) and hydric pine flatwoods range from $984.00 to $2,028.00 per acre.
Grading Grading costs for reforestation vary between $84.50 per acre and $361.87 per acre, and are slightly higher when using a D-11 bulldozer as compared to a D-9 (Table 10). Table 8.1: D-9 and D-11 bulldozer grading costs for forestry reclamation.
This averaging assumes that 50 percent of the farmland is in corn and 50 percent is in soybeans. For strip tillage, average fuel use is 2.4 gallons per acre. Average costs are $12.67 per acre in fuel and labor costs, $16.56 in implement costs, $20.06 in tractor overhead, giving average total costs of $49.29 per acre.
These average costs would increase to between $500 and $800 per acre per year on mined lands using more appropriate monitoring methodologies, which would include in addition to vegetation, soils, hydrology, water quality, aquatic fauna, wildlife, and ecosystem heterogeneity.
The two systems relying on little tillage (strip-till and no-till) have lower costs than the two systems using tillage (typical-till and deep-till). Total costs average $49.29 per acre for strip-till and $49.06 for no-till while typical-till has $58.79 and heavy-till has $60.70 in costs. There is $9.50 per acre difference in costs between strip-till, the low tillage system with the highest costs, and the typical-till, the lowest cost system using tillage.
IMC’s reported costs for upland habitat maintenance range from $120 per acre of improved pasture (6 treatments in two years) to $200 per acre for forested uplands (10 treatments over three years). IMC’s costs for wetland habitat maintenance are $200/acre and $320/acre for herbaceous and forested wetlands, respectively.
