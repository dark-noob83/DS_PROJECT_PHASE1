Riboflavin. This is one of the B vitamins and is often deficient in normal poultry feeds. If you are a breeder, deficiency of this vitamin causes embryo death during the early stages of incubation. This important vitamin is found in dairy products, yeast, liver, and plenty of leafy green vegetables. Calcium. Your layer hens need calcium to form strong, sturdy eggshells. Hens who don’t get enough calcium lay thin-shelled eggs, or eggs with no shell at all! The amount of calcium a hen needs varies with her age, diet, health, breed, and size.
Vitamins and minerals in chicken feed Of course, protein isn't the only factor your should consider when formulating your chicken feed (although it is very important.) You'll notice that our recipes for chicken laying feed and chicken starter/grower feed contain additional vitamins and minerals. What should you add to your grains and beans and why? First of all, laying hens need extra calcium to keep their eggshells strong.

Fat-Soluble Vitamins. Chickens need to ingest certain vitamins with fat in order for the vitamins to be properly absorbed into the bloodstream. Vitamins A, D, E and K are necessary for chicken fertility and the production of strong eggs. Chickens, like humans, require proper nutrition to grow healthy and strong. A lack of vitamins and minerals can lead to severe health problems and, in some cases, death. For chickens, proper nutrition is also vital for healthy egg production.
Feeding Chickens Supplements. Humans take daily vitamin supplements. Just like you, your backyard chickens may need vitamin and mineral feed supplements too! Common feed supplements include calcium, grit, phosphorus, and salt, not including some vitamins. Calcium. Your layer hens need calcium to form strong, sturdy eggshells. Hens who don’t get enough calcium lay thin-shelled eggs, or eggs with no shell at all! The amount of calcium a hen needs varies with her age, diet, health, breed, and size.
Your laying hens have different nutritional needs from roosters or chickens you might raise for meat. If you provide your flock with a high-quality feed designed for laying hens, you probably don't need to use vitamin supplements. However, if your hens' production falls off, or shell quality is poor, adding some vitamins to their diet might improve the situation. Egg Vitamin Deficiency. A lack of certain vitamins can produce symptoms in the hen and evidence in the eggs. Vitamin A deficiency results in fewer eggs. A lack of vitamin D also results in fewer eggs, along with thinner shells.
