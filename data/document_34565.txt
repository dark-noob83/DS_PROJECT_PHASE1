Container gardening or pot gardening is the practice of growing plants, including edible plants, exclusively in containers instead of planting them in the ground. A container is the general term used in gardening for a small, enclosed and usually portable object used for displaying live flowers or plants. It may take the form of a pot, box, tub, pot, basket, tin, barrel or hanging basket
Some plants don't do well in a window or a pot, or do well only for a very short time. Without understanding and managing expectations, it can be really misleading to beginners. Some things you can grow in the short-term in a pot, but you need to know what your plant needs before you decide short-term or long-term. GT: Beginners, especially, make the mistake of not understanding a plant and how it grows, and the worst thing you can do is try to grow something in a container that's too small. Size is where people can make the biggest difference in a plant's health. Learn about different types of containers.
A houseplant is a plant that is grown indoors in places such as residences and offices. Houseplants are commonly grown for decorative purposes, positive psychological effects, keeping fresh or health reasons such as indoor air purification. Sub-irrigation offers another alternative to top-watering techniques. In this approach the plant is watered from the bottom of the pot. Water is transferred up into the potting media (be it soil or others) by capillary action.
Container plants should be grown in a special potting mix that doesn't contain soil. Garden soil is too heavy and may compact roots, cutting off their oxygen. It also often contains weed seeds. Make or buy a soilless mix -- one composed of peat moss or coconut fiber (coir), vermiculite or perlite, and other ingredients. As a general rule, the larger the container for your potted plants, the less watering you'll need to do. The container material matters, too: A plant in a porous clay pot needs water more frequently than one in a plastic or ceramic pot.
Fertilizing Potted Plants. Every time you water a potted plant, nutrients leach out of the drain holes along with the excess water. An easy way to deal with fertilization is to use time-release organic fertilizers. Soil microbes activate organic fertilizers, which slowly release their nutrients to plants. As a general rule, the larger the container for your potted plants, the less watering you'll need to do.

Re-potting is the action of placing an already potted plant into a larger or smaller pot. A pot that fits a plant's root system better is normally used. Plants are usually re-potted according to the size of their root system. A container is the general term used in gardening for a small, enclosed and usually portable object used for displaying live flowers or plants.
Every plant needs the right soil, water, light, and fertilizer, but container-grown plants need a little bit more attention from a caregiver than those grown in the ground. Here's our guide to success with potted plants. As a general rule, the larger the container for your potted plants, the less watering you'll need to do.
