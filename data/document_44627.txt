Creatinine levels tend to be higher in men and people with large muscles. Measuring creatinine is only the first step to finding your level of kidney function. The normal serum creatinine range for men is 0.5-1.5 mg/dL. Creatinine clearance is a test sometimes used to estimate filtering capacity of the kidneys. The amount of creatinine in your urine is compared to the amount of creatinine in your blood. Your doctor may test your urine by asking you to collect your urine for 24 hours in a special container. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy men is 97-137 mL/min. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min
Creatinine and creatinine clearance tests measure creatinine levels in your blood and urine. These tests give information about how well your kidneys are working. The creatinine clearance value is found from the amounts of creatinine in the urine and blood and from the amount of urine you pass in 24 hours. Child: 0.3-0.7 mg/dL. Creatinine clearance: Men (younger than age 40): 107-139 milliliters per minute (mL/min) or 1.8-2.3 milliliters per second (mL/sec). Women (younger than age 40): 87-107 mL/min or 1.5-1.8 mL/sec. Creatinine clearance values normally go down as you get older.
The normal range of GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is 100-130 ml/min/1.73m 2 in men and women. In children, GFR measured by inulin clearance is 110 ml/min/1.73m 2 until 2 years of age in both sexes, and then it progressively decreases. One method of determining GFR from creatinine is to collect urine (usually for 24 hours) to determine the amount of creatinine that was removed from the blood over a given time interval. If one removes 1440 mg in 24 hours, this is equivalent to removing 1 mg/min.
Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. 
Results. Creatinine and creatinine clearance tests measure creatinine levels in your blood and urine to give information about how well your kidneys are working. The creatinine clearance value is found from the amounts of creatinine in the urine and blood and from the amount of urine you pass in 24 hours. 
Creatinine Clearance Test: Blood Creatinine Levels Normal Range. Creatinine clearance test measures the level of creatinine (a waste product) in the urine and blood. This test tells how your kidneys are functioning. Creatinine Clearance Test. This test assesses how well the kidneys eliminate creatinine from the blood. A Creatinine Clearance Test is more effective than a Serum Creatinine Test. The test is carried out on a urine sample collect through the interval of 24 hours, as well as on a blood sample.
The creatinine levels in both urine and blood are determined and compared. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min. and 97 to 137 mL/min. in males (normal levels may vary slightly between labs). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is another indicator of kidney function. Urea is also a metabolic byproduct which can build up if kidney function is impaired. The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. Elevated creatinine level signifies impaired kidney function or kidney disease.
Normal creatinine clearance levels for males and females are. 1  Men: Between 97 and 137 ml per min / 1.73 m2 (0.93 to 1.32 ml per sec / m2 IU). 2  Women: From 88 to 128 ml per min / 1.73 m2 (0.85 to 1.23 ml per sec / m2 IU). Creatinine Clearance Test. This test assesses how well the kidneys eliminate creatinine from the blood. A Creatinine Clearance Test is more effective than a Serum Creatinine Test. The test is carried out on a urine sample collect through the interval of 24 hours, as well as on a blood sample.
The range for a normal test result depends on your age and gender. For adults younger than 40, normal levels are typically in the range of: 107 to 139 mL/min or 1.78 to 2.32 mL/s (SI units) for men. 87 to 107 mL/min or 1.45 to 1.78 mL/s (SI units) for women. Creatinine clearance rates go down as you age. For every decade after age 40, a normal test result is 6.5 mL/min less than the numbers above. For newborns, the normal range is 40 to 65 mL/min. An abnormal creatinine clearance rate may mean you have a problem with your kidneys. Or it may mean a problem somewhere else in your body is affecting blood flow to the kidneys
