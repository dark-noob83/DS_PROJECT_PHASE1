The table below lists average sea level pressure in units commonly used. Values of Average Sea Level Pressure 1 ATM (atmosphere) 1013.25 millibars (mb) 14.7 pounds per square inch (lb/in2) 760 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg) or (inHg) 1013.25 hectoPascals (hPa). All of these pressure values are equivalent, meaning they express the same amount of pressure, i.e., average sea level pressure. 
Again, these are the average atmospheric pressures only at sea level. Pressure drops as we gain altitude; for instance, in Denver, approximately 1 mile above sea level, atmospheric pressure drops to approximately 12.2 PSI or 841.4 millibar. In American units of measure, it's 29.92 in. Hg (inches of mercury) or 14.696 psi (pounds per square inch). This means that, at sea level, the weight of air pressing on every square inch of something is almost 15 pounds.
(Answer #2). Although 1013.25 mb (760 mm Hg) is considered to be the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, it does not mean that the pressure at this level has this value, actually this being 1011 mb. At sea level, the approximate value of atmospheric pressure in those units of measure is as follows: 1  101.3 kPa which is how it is usually expressed. 2  In mmHg (milimeters of mercury), the measure is 760. 3  In atm (atmospheres) it is 1 atm.
The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure equal to 101325 Pa or 1013.25 hectopascals or millibars. Equivalent to 760 mmHg (torr), 29.92 inHg, 14.696 psi. (The pascal is a newton per square meter or in terms of SI base units, kilogram per meter per second-squared.). This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 14,000 feet (4,300 m) altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure —at 9,000 feet (2,700 m) and 1,000 feet (300 m)— as it was brought down towards sea level.
A not-commonly-used measurement is 'atmosphere'. One atmosphere is the average pressure at sea-level: 101.325 kPa, 1013.25 mbar, 29.921 inches of mercury (inHg) or 760 millime … ters of mercury (mmHg). Atmospheric pressure refers to the force per unit area exerted  against a surface by the weight of air above that surface in the  Earth's atmosphere. The standard atmosphere … (symbol: atm) is a unit  of pressure at sea level and is equal to 101325 Pascal.
Unfortunately for the student, there are many, many different units for measuring atmospheric pressure. Standard air pressure at sea level is most easily defined as 1 atmosphere, or 1 atm. In terms of an international (ISO) standard, it is defined to be 101325 Pa or 101.3 kPa (kilo-Pascals) at a temperature of 15 °C. In American units of measure, it's 29.92 in. Hg (inches of mercury) or 14.696 psi (pounds per square inch). This means that, at sea level, the weight of air pressing on every square inch of something is almost 15 pounds.
Average sea-level pressure is 101.325 kPa (1013.25 hPa or mbar) or 29.92 inches (inHg) or 760 millimetres of mercury (mmHg). This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 14,000 feet (4,300 m) altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure —at 9,000 feet (2,700 m) and 1,000 feet (300 m)— as it was brought down towards sea level.
For example, at mean sea level the standard gives a pressure of 101,325 pascals (14.6959 psi) (1 atm), a temperature of 15 °C (59 °F), a temperature lapse rate of −6.5 °C (20.3 °F) per km (roughly −2°C (-3.6°F) per 1,000 ft), and a density of 1.2250 kilograms per cubic meter (0.07647 lb/cu ft). To allow modeling conditions below mean sea level, the troposphere actually extends to about −610 meters (−2,000 ft), where the temperature is 19 °C (66 °F), pressure is 108,900 pascals (15.79 psi), and density is 1.2985 kilograms per cubic meter (0.08106
Standard temperature is defined as zero degrees Celsius (0 0 C), which translates to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32 0 F) or 273.15 degrees kelvin (273.15 0 K). This is essentially the freezing point of pure water at sea level, in air at standard pressure. Standard pressure supports 760 millimeters in a mercurial barometer (760 mmHg). This is about 29.9 inches of mercury, and represents approximately 14.7 pounds per inch (14.7 lb/in 2). Standard temperature and pressure, abbreviated STP, refers to nominal conditions in the atmosphere at sea level. This value is important to physicists, chemists, engineers, and pilots and navigators.
Posted on. (Answer #3). The atmospheric pressure at the sea level is equal to 760 mm of height of the column of mercury. With this height of 760 mm of mecury, the atmospheric pressure is equal to the weight force of the 760 mm of mercury. At sea level, the approximate value of atmospheric pressure in those units of measure is as follows: 1  101.3 kPa which is how it is usually expressed. 2  In mmHg (milimeters of mercury), the measure is 760. 3  In atm (atmospheres) it is 1 atm.
