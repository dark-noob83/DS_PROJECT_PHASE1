EDFA stands for Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier. The BaySpecâ€™s EDFA series products are mainly for metro applications. S-, C-, and L-Band: S-Band (short band) is not well defined.
PHYSICAL MODEL: An Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) consists of a piece of fiber of length L, whose core is uniformly doped with Erbium ions.
The optical signal, such as a 1550nm signal, enters an EDFA from the input. The 1550nm signal is combined with a 980nm pump laser with a WDM device. The signal and the pump laser pass through a length of fiber doped with Erbium ions. The 1550nm signal is amplified through interaction with the doping
EDFA. EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier) is a kind of fiber optic amplifier which used to re-amplify an attenuated signal without converting the signal into electrical form.
EDFA stands for Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier and it is one type of many different optical amplifiers. Optical amplifiers amplify an optical signal directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. This process is significantly cheaper and started a fiber optic revolution.
Short for erbium-doped fiber amplifier. EDFA is an optical repeater device that is used to boost the intensity of optical signals being carried through a fiber optic communications system. An optical fiber is doped with the rare earth element erbium so that the glass fiber can absorb light at one frequency and emit light at another frequency.
