That is, the partial pressure of oxygen is the pressure developed by the oxygen molecules, the partial pressure of nitrogen is the pressure developed by nitrogen molecules, and similarly for the other components of the mixture.
The alveolar gas equation allows the calculation of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen from data that is practically measurable. It was first characterized in 1946.
Since inspired air is 21% oxygen and atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg (at sea level), the partial pressure of oxygen is 0.21 x 760 mmHg = 160 mmHg. As air moves into the alveoli, water vapor and carbon dioxide are added, and that reduces the partial pressure of oxygen to about 100 mmHg in the alveolar gas.
Definition. The partial pressure of a given gas is defined as the pressure exerted by that gas alone. For example, consider the gaseous mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, the typical mixture found in alveolar gas.
Partial pressure affects the movement of oxygen from the alveoli to  the blood because it is the main driving force for oxygen movement  in the lungs.Oxygen passes from the â€¦ air to the fluid within the  alveoli, into the cell of the alveoli.
Lung Capillaries. 20-40. The alveolar oxygen partial pressure is lower than the atmospheric O 2 partial pressure for two reasons. 1  Firstly, as the air enters the lungs, it is humidified by the upper airway and thus the partial pressure of water vapour (47 mmHg) reduces the oxygen partial pressure to about 150 mmHg.
Before discussing alveolar and arterial partial pressure of oxygen, it will be helpful to clarify the concept of oxygen diffusing capacity. Oxygen enters the blood by diffusion from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries.
The partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) in the pulmonary alveoli is required to calculate both the alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen and the amount of right-to-left cardiac shunt, which are both clinically useful quantities.
