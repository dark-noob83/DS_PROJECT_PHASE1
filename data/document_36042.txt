1 The new RCCB is best because it will detect any earth fault. 2  The voltage type only detects earth faults that flow back through the main earth wire so this is why they stopped being used. 3  The easy way to tell an old voltage operated trip is to look for the main earth wire connected through it. 1 ELCB is the old name and often refers to voltage operated devices that are no longer available and it is advised you replace them if you find one. 2  RCCB or RCD is the new name that specifies current operated (hence the new name to distinguish from voltage operated).
A RCD does not provide protection against unexpected or dangerously high current when current is flowing in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault does not lead to current leakage. An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a residual-current device, although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists. In German speaking countries the device is sometimes known as FI where the F stands for fault (Fehler) and I for the symbol that represents Electric current.

A residual-current device (RCD), or residual-current circuit breaker (RCCB), is a device to quickly disconnect current to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a person falls after receiving a shock. An earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a residual-current device, although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists. In German speaking countries the device is sometimes known as FI where the F stands for fault (Fehler) and I for the symbol that represents Electric current.
ELECTRICALS RCCB 1 The flow of current through electrical facilities always involves risks. Poorly insulated equipment, faulty wires and incorrect use of an electrical device cause currents to flow through the wrong path (i.e. through the insulation) to the earth. 
Purpose of RCCB. Residual Current Circuit Breakers are aimed at protecting an individual from the risks of electrical shocks, electrocution and fires that are caused due to faulty wiring or earth faults. RCCB is particularly useful in situations where there is a sudden earth fault occurring in the circuit. A Residual Current Circuit Breakers is another different class of Circuit Breakers. A Residual Current Circuit Breaker (RCCB) is essentially a current sensing device used to protect a low voltage circuit in case of a fault. It contains a switch device that switches off whenever a fault occurs in the connected circuit.

A residual current device (RCD), or residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), is an electrical wiring device that disconnects a circuit whenever it detects that the flow of current is not balanced between the phase (hot) conductor and the neutral conductor. This simulates a fault by creating an imbalance in the sense coil. If the RCD does not trip when this button is pressed then the device must be replaced. [edit] Rules and regulations Use and regulations differ widely from country to country. In Europe, the UK is the only country that does not mandate the use of RCDs.
In such situation, in absence of an RCCB in the circuit, an earth fault may occur and the person is at the risk of receiving an electrical shock. However, if the same circuit is protected with RCCB, it will trip the circuit in fraction of a second thus preventing the person from receiving an electrical shock.
