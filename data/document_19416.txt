Viruses that infect bacteria are called bacteriophages. The name is derived from the Greek word phage which means to eat or to devour. Initial observations of bacteriophages were done on bacterial plates, where an unknown entity devoured the bacterial population, hence the name.
bacteriophage. A bacteriophage is a type of virus that infects bacteria. In fact, the word bacteriophage literally means bacteria eater, because bacteriophages destroy their host cells. All bacteriophages are composed of a nucleic acid molecule that is surrounded by a protein structure.
In order to infect a host cell, the bacteriophage attaches itself to the bacteria’s cell wall, specifically on a receptor found on the bacteria’s surface. Once it becomes tightly bound to the cell, the bacterial virus injects its genetic material (its nucleic acid) into the host cell.
Bacterial viruses are specific to one or a limited number of bacteria; thus, they are named after the bacteria group, strain, or species that they infect. For example, the phages that infect the bacterium Escherichia coli are called coliphages.
Bacterial viruses -- bacteriophages, also called “phages” -- are a group of viruses that infect and kill only bacteria. They are distinct from viruses that infect animals or plants. Phages can have either a lytic lifestyle or a lysogenic one.
A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria. Bacteriophages, first discovered around 1915, have played a unique role in viral biology. They are perhaps the best understood viruses, yet at the same time, their structure can be extraordinarily complex.
