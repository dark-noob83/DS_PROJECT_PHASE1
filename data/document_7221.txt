The American Association of Physicists in Medicine conducts an annual survey of salaries for its members. In the 2007 study, the median salary for a medical physicist without board certification was $115,000 (master's degree) and $124,000 (Ph.D.). With board certification, the median salary rose to $162,200 (master's degree) and $175,000 (Ph.D.). Most of the medical physicist jobs (85 percent) are in a field of therapy, according to Duke University.
Medical Physicists enjoy a hefty income, with average pay passing six figures ($130K) annually in the United States. Overall cash earnings for Medical Physicists stretch from $65K on the lower end to $189K near the top, and the heftiest packages can encompass around $10K from bonuses and $17K from profit sharing.
The medical physicist salary is above average, at around $60,000 to $167,000 per year, when compared to the salary of all other occupations in the US. This increases to about $140,000 to $250,000 for those who are already board certified. Conclusion about medical physicist salary.

Salaries. According to Salary Experts.com, the median salary for a medical physicist with less than a year of experience is around $50,000 a year. With 1 to 4 years of experience, the median salary increases to around $100,000 a year. With board certification, the median salary rose to $162,200 (master's degree) and $175,000 (Ph.D.). Most of the medical physicist jobs (85 percent) are in a field of therapy, according to Duke University.
Starting Salary Range. Starting salaries for physics majors in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math for 2009 and 2010 graduates ranged from about $40,000 to about $60,000 per year, according to the American Institute of Physics. Starting salaries in civilian government jobs ranged from about $38,000 to about $58,000. These were generally the highest starting salaries for people with a Bachelor of Science in physics. The top starting salary for a physics major hired in a university setting was about $40,000. This would mean the most likely starting pay rate in science, technology, engineering and math opportunities for physics majors would be in the range of $45,000 to $55,000, with the midpoint at $50,000. In civilian government jobs, it would be in the range of $43,000 to $53,000, with the midpoint at $48,000.
Similarly, the medical physicist’s salary in the hospitals ranges from $87,700 to $162,188, while the salary in radiology is around $74,776 to $116,653 a year. The degree held by the physicist also matters in determining their salary. Conclusion about medical physicist salary. The medical physicist salary is above average, at around $60,000 to $167,000 per year, when compared to the salary of all other occupations in the US. This increases to about $140,000 to $250,000 for those who are already board certified. 1  Share on Facebook.
