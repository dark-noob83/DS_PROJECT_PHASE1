Hi, My partner has noticed posts advertised for teachers at The Gulf English School. She is a mathematics teacher, currently working in the UK at Secondary Level and can teach up to Key stage 5 I think. I would try and find out vis this website or other qatar based ones what the school is actually like. I am a teacher here in Qatar but not at the The Gulf English School. I made the mistake of not contacting teachers at the school I am based at, I have paid the price for my folly.
