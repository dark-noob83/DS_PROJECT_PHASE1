:) Average cost for local modeling, minimum is about $10 an hour. High fashion (non minimum wage) can increase up to thousands an hour depending on your popularity and experience. All though the average model makes up to $80 an hour.
In other words, the agency actually gets 40% of the hourly rate — 20% from you and 20% from the model — and the model gets 80% of the rate. A typical model rate through an agency is $150–$200 per hour. So one model for a few hours of studio work may cost you around $720 ($150 x 4,+20%). There may also be a fee based on the intended usage of the photos. And the agency may require that the model release(s) be submitted through them.
Modeling pay rates can be per hour, flat rate or a day rate. If the shoot is short (1-3 hours), then an hourly rate is appropriate (i.e. $50 - $75/hour for models with a bit of experience and $75 - $100/hour or higher for experienced/pro models).
Models earned average wages of $13.38 per hour, or $27,830 per year, as of May 2011, states the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average salaries rose beyond $21.08 per hour, or $43,840 per year, or fell to less than $7.68 per hour, or $15,960 per year.
For example, in Portland, Oregon, modeling agencies fees were $150 an hour. Larger markets fees for photographers and models go up (one agency in New York was asking $250 per hour). You can make a good living if you can find steady work. And that is a big if.
