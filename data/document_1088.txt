autotroph is when an organism can make it's own food. heterotroph is when an organism is not capable of making it's on food. for example: plants are autotrophs. Photosynth … esis is the way they make their food. An animal like us, humans is a heterotroph. Our bodies can not make food for us. A parasite is also a heterotroph. A parasite feeds  off other organisms for its food. An example of a parasite is a  deet tick. An example of a decomposing heterotroph is an earthworm.  An earthworm decomposes biological matter in soil for its food. An  example of a consuming heterotroph is a bunny

Yes. Autotrophs produce their own food, usually by photosynthesis. Mosses are green plants that can produce their own food from sunlight by photosynthesis. 1 This type of moss can benefit the plants in your landsc…. 2  Creative Ideas for Growing Moss in Your Yard Moss has a variety of colors and looks, but, no matter what, moss is low-growing, hardy, soft and beautiful when implemented correctly.
First, all plants undergo an alternation of generations, between a haploid gametophyte stage and a diploid sporophyte stage. In the most primitive plants, like mosses, the gametophyte is dominant (i.e. it's big and green). In higher plants like ferns and fern allies, the sporophyte stage is dominant. They also lack true stems, roots, or leaves, though they have cells that perform these general functions. The leafy green plant that we see when we look at a moss or a liverwort is really the gametophyte, which is the dominant stage in all bryophytes. The sporophytes of bryophytes do not have a free-living existence.

Pine gametophyte (outside) surrounding the embryo (inside). A gametophyte is the haploid multicellular stage in the alternation of generations life cycle of plants and algae. It develops from a spore by mitotic cell division. Spores are the products of meiosis in sporophytes. Gametophytes produce haploid gametes by mitosis. In some types of plants and algae (e.g. Ulva) gametes are isogamous --that is, the gametes are all of one size, shape and general morphology. In bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts), the gametophyte represents the longer lived, nutritionally independent and more visible stage of the life cycle. Sporophytes are typically attached to and dependent on gametophytes. Moss gametophytes originate from the germination of a spore.
No. Mosses belong in the Phylum Bryophyta, along with other bryophyte phyla such as Phylum Hepatophyta (liverworts) and Phylum Anthocerotophyta (hornworts). On the other hand, … Club moss (Phylum Lycopodophyta) is not a bryophyte at all, let alone a true moss. Club moss is more closely related to plants of the pteridophyte division, which includes ferns, whisk ferns and horsetails. 1 This type of moss can benefit the plants in your landsc…. 2  Creative Ideas for Growing Moss in Your Yard Moss has a variety of colors and looks, but, no matter what, moss is low-growing, hardy, soft and beautiful when implemented correctly.
An autotroph is a being that can produce its own food from a variety of sources. Use this study guide to learn how autotrophs-such as weird plants, colorful algae, and microscopic bacteria-live all around us. slide 1 of 4. Autotrophs (also called producers) can form their own food either by using sunlight and photosynthesis (phototrophs) or by obtaining chemical energy through oxidation (chemotrophs).
For the most part, autotrophs often make their own food by using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to form sugars which they can use for energy. Some examples of autotrophs include plants, algae, and even some bacteria. Autotrophs are important because they are a food source for heterotrophs (consumers). Now, let's look at 10 examples of autotrophs all around us. Autotrophs (also called producers) can form their own food either by using sunlight and photosynthesis (phototrophs) or by obtaining chemical energy through oxidation (chemotrophs).
