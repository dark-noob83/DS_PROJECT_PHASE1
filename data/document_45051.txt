The anaerobic threshold: definition, physiological significance and identification. Wasserman K. During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (AT). The oxygen consumption at the AT depends on factors that affect oxygen delivery to the tissues.
Top 10 amazing movie makeup transformations. A person's anaerobic threshold has been reached when their body is under extreme conditions and the burning of oxygen can not keep up with the body's demands. At this point, the body begins to burn stored fuels, like sugars, instead of oxygen as the primary fuel. The word anaerobic literally means without oxygen..
Anaerobic Threshold (AT) was a term applied to the lactate inflection point, or the point at which the appearance of lactate in the blood accumulates faster that its rate of use.
The Anaerobic Threshold. The anaerobic threshold (AT), also called the “lactate threshold,” is the exertion level between aerobic and anaerobic training. The AT is the point during exercise when your body must switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.
A person's anaerobic threshold has been reached when their body is under extreme conditions and the burning of oxygen can not keep up with the body's demands.

The anaerobic threshold (AT), the point at which lactic acid starts to accumulates in the muscles, is considered to be somewhere between 85% and 90% of your maximum heart rate (HRmax) .
The Anaerobic Threshold (AT) is the physiological point during exercise at which lactic acid starts to accumulate in the muscles, which occurs around the point during increasing intensity exercise that anaerobic processes become more dominant.
