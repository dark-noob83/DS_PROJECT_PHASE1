A typical desktop computer uses about 65 to 250 watts. To find the figure for your particular computer you can contact the manufacturer (not me), or see my section on measuring electrical use. Add another 20-40 watts for an LCD monitor, or about 80 watts if you have an old-school 17. CRT. You use it for two hours a day, five days a week. That's 105 watts x 10 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 54,600 watt-hours, or 54.6 kWh. If you're paying 10 per kilowatt-hour, then you're paying about $5.50 a year to run your computer.
For example, let's say you have a big high-end computer with a gaming-level graphics card and an old CRT monitor, and you leave them on 24/7. That's about 200 watts x 24 hours x 365 days/yr = 1,752,000 watt-hours, or 1752 kilowatt-hours. If you're paying $0.36 per kWh, you're paying $631 a year to run your computer. (In California, PG&E's highest tier is $0.33/kWh, and the average in Hawaii is $0.36/kWh. You use it for two hours a day, five days a week. That's 105 watts x 10 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 54,600 watt-hours, or 54.6 kWh. If you're paying 10 per kilowatt-hour, then you're paying about $5.50
Best Answer: Typically about 300W, but can range from 200W to over 500W (servers even use over 1,000 watts), depending on how powerful the computer is. If you're capable, take the cover off your computer and look for the power supply. The power cord plugs into it (from the outside of course) and has a fan. If it's nothing exceptional, 300 watts for the computer and 200 watts for the monitor. High power machines can be 500 or 600 watts and 18 inch CRT monitors are around 300 watts.
Asker's rating. Report Abuse. Most average computers use about 250 - 300 Watts, depending on what you use it for. You can check by just taking off the side panel, and there should be a sticker on the side of the PSU stating how much it uses. tensa_zangetsu09 Â· 8 years ago. Thumbs up.
Due to using faster, higher-power parts, desktop computers use significantly more power than laptops, which generally use fewer than 100 watts. Desktop computers can vary significantly, but a typical computer under average load uses around 65 to 250 watts. For a PC with a high-end video card, add another 150 to 300 watts while rendering graphics.
An average desktop computer uses between 60 and 300 watts. It is very difficult to know exactly how much computers use on average because there are so many different hardware configurations. The computer power supply is not an accurate way to measure energy use because the power supply output is advertised as the max amount of watts a power supply can output. We estimate that an average modern desktop PC will use approximately 100 watts of power, not including the display screen. Click calculate to find the energy consumption of a desktop computer using 100 Watts for 6 hours a day @ $0.10 per a kWh.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. An average Desktop's Wattage may be around 300-400 W, but high end Gaming computers may require up to 1500W at the most. 
Source(s): my computer uses 248 and laptop uses 68. The computer i wanted (with tec coolers) would consume 450 watts for the cpu, 400 watts for graphics 2 cards, 100 watts for everything else, and 400 watts in cooling. Its about 1400 watts total. If I use a newer processor and graphics, it'll drop to about 800 watts. 
Get Connected. An average desktop computer has a power usage of between 80 and 250 watts, depending on graphics cards and additional peripherals. The cost to the University to operate a typical computer and monitor workstation (130 watts @ 11c kW/h) for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, is $129.73.
