Agmatine is naturally produced in the body by the breakdown of arginine. Supplementing with agmatine sulfate does many of the same things that arginine should do, but it seems to be much more effective.
Agmatine sulfate naturally occurs as the “decarboxylation” product of the amino acid arginine. You remember arginine — an older form of it (Arginine AKG) was in the original Jack3d pre workout as its only pump product.
Agmatine, also known as (4-aminobutyl)guanidine, is an aminoguanidine that was discovered in 1910 by Albrecht Kossel. It is a common natural compound synthesized by decarboxylation of the amino acid arginine, hence also known as decarboxylated arginine.
The generally accepted daily dosage range for Agmatine Sulfate is anywhere between 250 mg and 2.5 grams. However, you do want to be careful when taking extremely high doses. The best way to use this supplement is about 30-45 minutes before a workout.
Agmantine Sulfate is naturally produced in the body when Arginine, an amino acid is decarboxylated in an individual’s body. Since the production of Agmantine Sulfate is low in the body, it needs to be given a boost for it to be effective. The best way to do this is to find other sources apart from the body and some of the best sources include different foods and supplements.
Agmatine also known as (4-aminobutyl)guanidine is an aminoguanidine that was discovered in 1910 by the Nobel laureate Albrecht Kossel. Agmatine is a perculiar chemical that is a derivative of the much more popular and well know L-arginine (often used in sports supplements).
Agmatine Sulfate is a biogenic amine that is derived from the amino acid L-Arginine. This occurs due to a process called decarboxylation, which is the removal of a carboxylic acid group from the amino acid.
1 Agmatine is commonly found in pre workout supplements and is classified as a nitric oxide booster. 2  Agmatine can be produced in the body from l-arginine, but in supplement form it occurs as agmatine sulfate.
