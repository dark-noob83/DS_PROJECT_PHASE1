And on this evidence, the human genome is set to get smaller still. “Our evidence suggests that the final number of true protein coding genes in the reference genome may lie closer to 19,000 than to 20,000.”. Which means that humans have fewer protein-coding genes even than nematode worms. Then, they believed humans could have as many as 2 million protein-coding genes. But by the time the human genome project began in the late 1990s, the highest estimates put the number at 100,000 and the number has continued to shrink.
The human genome of Homo sapiens is stored on 23 chromosome pairs. 22 of these are autosomal chromosome pairs, while the remaining pair is sex-determining. The haploid human genome occupies a total of just over 3 billion DNA base pairs that means 6 billion base pairs per diploid cell. 
Scientists have discovered that there are 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. If a person has one allele for brown eye color and one for blue, the person's eyes will be brown. One gene pair dictates hair color. There have been genes found associated with a propensity to becoming overweight. 10 most extreme places on Earth. The human genome has just over 3 billion DNA base pairs encoding 750 MB of information and containing 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. This is substantially less than initial estimates of 100,000 or more
Before the completion of the Human Genome Project, most biologists expected to. There are 23 chromosomal pairs in the human genome. There are an estimated 20,000-25,000 genes in the human genome. It is approximately 25000 per cell. 16 Contributions. No,the scientists were not correct in their estimate of how many genes would be identified during the human genome project because they had identified an estimated 30,000 gene … s (instead of the expected 100,000), constituting just 1% of the total human.
The Human Genome Project has found out that there are around 20,000-25,000 'haploid' protein coding genes present in our body. With the help of completed human sequence it is now possible to identify the locations of these genes. 
The total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base pairs. The genome is organized into 22 paired chromosomes, plus the X chromosome (one in males, two in females) and, in males only, one Y chromosome. These are all large linear DNA molecules contained within the cell nucleus. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos. Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.
The human genome was the first of all vertebrates to be completely sequenced. As of 2012, thousands of human genomes have been completely sequenced, and many more have been mapped at lower levels of resolution. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos. Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.
The Human Genome Project produced the first complete sequences of individual human genomes, with the first draft sequence and initial analysis being published on February 12, 2001. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos. Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.
