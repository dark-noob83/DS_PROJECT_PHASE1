A CubeSat is a small satellite in the shape of a 10 centimeter cube and weighs just 1 kilogram. That's about 4 inches and 2 pounds. The design has been simplified so almost anyone can build them and the instructions are available for free online. 
The CubeSat program began in 1999 as a collaboration between California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University. The goal was to design a standard for picosatellites, tiny Earth-orbiting boxes usually with a volume of about 61 cubic inches (1 liter) and a mass of about 2.9 lbs. (1.33 kilograms). 
Standard CubeSats are made up of 10×10×11.35 cm units designed to provide 10×10×10 cm or 1 liter of useful volume while weighing no more than 1.33 kg (2.9 lb) per unit. The smallest standard size is 1U and 3U is the largest which does not occupy allowed extra volumes. P-PODs are mounted to a launch vehicle and carry CubeSats into orbit and deploy them once the proper signal is received from the launch vehicle. The P-POD Mk III has capacity for three 1U CubeSats, or other 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U CubeSats combination up to a maximum volume of 3U.
3U CubeSats which utilize the space are designated 3U+ and may place components in a cylindrical volume centered on one end of the CubeSat. The cylindrical space has a maximum diameter of 6.4 cm and a height no greater than 3.6 cm while not allowing for any increase in mass beyond the 3U's maximum of 4 kg. P-PODs are mounted to a launch vehicle and carry CubeSats into orbit and deploy them once the proper signal is received from the launch vehicle. The P-POD Mk III has capacity for three 1U CubeSats, or other 0.5U, 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U CubeSats combination up to a maximum volume of 3U.
The basic building block of cubesats is a cube measuring 4 inches (10 centimeters) on each side. Satellites that consist of just a single such block are known as 1U (short for one unit) cubesats; those that combine two or three of them are 2U and 3U, respectively. Small and economical cubesats already eye our planet from orbit. But such bantam craft are about to start pushing out into deep space, helping researchers study and explore the moon, asteroids and other distant bodies.
The CubeSat Kit is designed to help you complete a successful CubeSat mission in as short a time as possible, and at low cost. Each CubeSat Kit includes: 1  A rugged Development Board that you use in the lab to prototype mission-specific hardware, develop software, test your ideas, measure performance, etc. All you need beyond the CubeSat kit is a PC with a USB port and a CubeSat-Kit certified C compiler / Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You use the compiler and IDE to develop software for this MCU.
(Page excerpted from WIkipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat). A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that usually has a volume of exactly one liter (10 cm cube), has a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms, [1] and typically uses commercial off-the-shelf components for its electronics. 1U cubesat structure without outer skin. [2]. The standard 10×10×10 cm basic CubeSat is often called a “1U” CubeSat meaning one unit. CubeSats are scalable along only one axis, by 1U increments. CubeSats such as a “2U” CubeSat (20×10×10 cm) and a “3U” CubeSat (30×10×10 cm) have been both built and launched.
Thirteen CubeSats are set to launch aboard an Atlas V rocket with the NROL-55 primary payload from Vandenberg Air Force Base on October 8th, 2015. The CubeSat payloads have been provided through NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program and the NRO's Mission Integration Directorate (MID). Below is information about each CubeSat including tracking information where available and links to developers' websites.
