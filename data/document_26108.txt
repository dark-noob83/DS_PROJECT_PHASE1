Small bowel follow through (SBFT) is an X-ray exam of the small intestine to the large intestines. Read this handout to learn about how the exam works, how it is done, how to prepare for it, what to expect during the exam, and how to get your results.
Upper gastrointestinal tract radiography, also called an upper GI, is an x-ray examination of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine (also known as the duodenum). Images are produced using a special form of x-ray called fluoroscopy and an orally ingested contrast material such as barium.
An upper GI and small bowel series is done in a health care office or hospital radiology department. You may get an injection of a medicine that slows muscle movement in the small intestine. This makes it easier to see the structures of your organs on the x-rays.
The study is done while you are drinking barium. The barium appears white on X-rays, and shows the outline of the internal lining of the small bowel. An X-ray is taken every 30 minutes tracking the progression of the barium. It will be necessary to drink 1 cup of barium after each X-ray until it has progressed through the small bowel and enters the large intestine.
What is rad-ugi-sbft? This stands for: rad(RAD) Radiology, ugi (UGI) Upper Gastrointestinal, sbft(Small Bowel Follow Through). These are tests done in Radiology This means a Radiologist will have you drink a liquid-Barium, for the UGI and take films of the barium going down the esophagus, stomach and duodenum.
An upper GI and small bowel series is a set of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Barium enema is a related test.
