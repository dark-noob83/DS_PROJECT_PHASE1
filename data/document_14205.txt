The molar volume, symbol V m, is the volume occupied by one mole of a substance (chemical element or chemical compound) at a given temperature and pressure. It is equal to the molar mass (M) divided by the mass density (ρ). Hence, for a given temperature and pressure, the molar volume is the same for all ideal gases and is known to the same precision as the gas constant: R = 0.08206 L atm K −1 mol −1, that is a relative standard uncertainty of 9.1×10 −7, according to the 2010 CODATA recommended value.
To convert between moles and the volume of a gas at STP, we will use the factor label method discussed in the first unit. This conversions relies on the fact that a mole of gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 L. It is important to note, however, that if the conditions of the gas are different this conversion will NOT work. 
Standard molar volume of a gas is the volume occupied by 1 mole of any gas at 273 K and 1 atmospheric pressure (STP). It is equal to 22.4 liters of 22,400 ml. It is the same for all gases. S.T.P. Molar volume is considered to be the volume occupied by one mole of any gas at a given pressure and temperature. This is denoted by V m. The Molar volume unit is found to be litre per mole or milliliter per mole.
For ideal gases, the molar volume is given by the ideal gas equation: this is a good approximation for many common gases at standard temperature and pressure. For crystalline solids, the molar volume can be measured by X-ray crystallography. Hence, for a given temperature and pressure, the molar volume is the same for all ideal gases and is known to the same precision as the gas constant: R = 0.08206 L atm K −1 mol −1, that is a relative standard uncertainty of 9.1×10 −7, according to the 2010 CODATA recommended value.
The molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at STP. Its value is: 22.414 L mol¯ 1. It is actually known to several more decimal places but the number above should prove sufficient.This value has been known for about 200 years and it is not a constant of nature like, say, the charge on the electron. 
The volume of one mole of gas is called the molar gas volume. The volume of gas produced in a chemical reaction can be measured by collecting it over water. Let’s discuss the determination of the molar volume of gas and its applications. Molar volume is considered to be the volume occupied by one mole of any gas at a given pressure and temperature. This is denoted by V m. The Molar volume unit is found to be litre per mole or milliliter per mole.
Use Avogadro’s law to determine the number of moles of butane gas. Assume that butane is an ideal gas and that one mole has a volume of 22.4 L at STP. V 1 /n 1 = V 2 /n 2 0.0896 L/n = 22.4 L/1 mole n = 0.0040 moles 12. Experimental molar mass (g/mole) of butane: 0.23 g/0.0040 moles = 58 g/mole 13. The molecular formula of butane is C 4 H 10. Calculate its molar mass. Use the combined gas law to determine the volume (in L) of butane at STP.11. Use Avogadro’s law to determine the number of moles of butane gas.
