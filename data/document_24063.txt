Average Cost of Cataract Surgery. The average cost of Cataract surgery in a Medicare outpatient setting is generally around $2,500.00/eye for the surgeon, the out patient facility, and the anesthesia provider. Medicare would pay 80% or $2,000.00/eye and you would pay the remaining $500.00 out of pocket
If you want a high-tech, presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens for your cataract procedure, then costs would increase to an average of about $4,591 per eye (vs. $4,461 in 2010, $4,337 in 2011, $4,269 in 2012 and $4,350 in 2013). 1 An average additional charge of $2,188 per eye for a premium, presbyopia-correcting IOL, if you already have Medicare coverage for basic cataract surgery costs. 2  An average additional charge of $607 per eye, if you need an extra surgical procedure to correct mild astigmatism.
1 For patients not covered by health insurance, cataract surgery typically costs $5,000 to $10,000 per eye, for a total of $10,000 to $20,000 for both eyes. 2  For example, at Park Nicollet, a hospital in Minneapolis, Minn., it costs about $4,365 per eye -- a total of $8,730 for both eyes. 1 Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed. 2  This typically costs $250 to $450 and usually is covered by insurance.
1 Cataract surgery is covered by most health insurance plans. 2  Many patients who need cataract surgery are 65 or older, and Medicare covers cataract surgery. 3  For patients covered by insurance, typical out-of-pocket costs would consist of coinsurance of 10 to 20 percent or more -- or $1,000 or more for both eyes. 1 Within five years after cataract surgery, one in four patients develop cloudiness on part of the lens capsule that remains in the eye after surgery; to correct this, a five-minute procedure, called YAG laser capsulotomy, is needed. 2  This typically costs $250 to $450 and usually is covered by insurance.

Extra costs associated with laser cataract surgery are unlikely to be covered by Medicare or private health insurance. Fees vary from one cataract surgeon to another, but it is likely you would pay a few hundred dollars extra per eye out-of-pocket for a laser-assisted procedure. 
With any insurance.. medicare or other,.. your cost for a standard cataract surgery will be 500-550 per eye.. unless you choose.. crystalens.. then you can expect to pay.. 1200+..and the best thing to do is ask your Dr. (surgeon) for sample eye drops.. all of them will give you samples.. why pay
