Low-fat cow's milk and goat's milk are both rich in dietary protein, calcium, potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D. They both contain about 8 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of total fat, 10 to 12 grams of carbohydrates, about 10 milligrams of cholesterol, and about 100 milligrams of sodium. Calorie Content. Calorie Content. Low-fat goat milk contains slightly fewer calories (90 calories) than low-fat cow's milk, which provides 110 calories in each 1-cup serving. However, low-fat goat milk is comparable to fat-free cow's milk, which also contains about 90 calories per cup.
ASH. The total ash (calcium, phosphorous, etc.) content of goat's milk ranges from 0.78 mg to 0.83 mg per 100 g milk and is considered to be slightly higher than that associated with the cow (Table 1). However, the relative percentages of the ash components appear to be comparable (Table 3). The average total fat content in the milk is similar to that found in other ruminant species, (Table 1) despite reports that the percentage of fat in goat's milk exceeds that of the cow.
Most of you know that the type of calcium is critical to absorption. Goat's milk happens to be loaded with calcium 326 mg in raw goat's milk compared to 290 mg in raw cow's milk. And goat milk fat globules, form of protein etc. is much easier to digest than cow's milk. This ability to digest easier means more absorption. I haven't found out how much magnesium is in goat milk but I did find out that bones are very high in phosphorus and goat's milk has 270 mg in comparison to 227 mg in cow's milk. Another big factor in building strong bones is engaging in weight bearing exercise, which is a part of owning goats.
Cow milk provides more vitamins overall than goat milk. Goat milk provides 327 milligrams of calcium per serving, or 33 percent of the DV; 34 milligrams of magnesium, or 9 percent of the DV; 271 milligrams of phosphorus, or 27 percent of the DV; and 498 milligrams of potassium, or 14 percent of the DV. A 1-cup serving of whole goat milk contains 168 calories, 9 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrate and 10 grams of fat, including 7 grams of saturated fat.
Minerals. Goat milk provides 327 milligrams of calcium per serving, or 33 percent of the DV; 34 milligrams of magnesium, or 9 percent of the DV; 271 milligrams of phosphorus, or 27 percent of the DV; and 498 milligrams of potassium, or 14 percent of the DV. A 1-cup serving of whole goat milk contains 168 calories, 9 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrate and 10 grams of fat, including 7 grams of saturated fat.
A 1-cup serving of vitamin D fortified whole cow milk contains the same amount of vitamin D and thiamine as a cup of goat milk but more riboflavin, with 0.4 milligrams or 24 percent of the DV, and more vitamin B-12, with 1.1 micrograms or 18 percent of the DV. A 1-cup serving of whole goat milk contains 168 calories, 9 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrate and 10 grams of fat, including 7 grams of saturated fat.
Goat's Milk, Calcium and Other Nutrients. Goat's milk supplies 327 milligrams of calcium per cup. This is more than the calcium in a cup of whole-fat cow's milk, which has about 276 milligrams per cup. Goat's milk also supplies other nutrients that work in synergy with calcium to promote bone health. Phosphorus, for example, makes up over 50 percent of bone mineral mass, and goat's milk is rich in phosphorus, with about 271 milligrams per cup. Goat's milk supplies 483 international units of vitamin A and 124 international units of vitamin D, which helps boost bone strength by aiding in calcium absorption.
In terms of cholesterol, goat's milk appears to offer a specific distinction in comparison to cow's milk, Cow's milk typically contains about 14 to 17 mg cholesterol per 100 g milk, while goat's milk is more usually recorded at 11 to 25 mg per 100 gram of milk. The average total fat content in the milk is similar to that found in other ruminant species, (Table 1) despite reports that the percentage of fat in goat's milk exceeds that of the cow.
