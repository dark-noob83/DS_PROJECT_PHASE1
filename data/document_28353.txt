On this anniversary, we countdown the largest volcanic eruptions in history as measured by the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) a classification system somewhat akin to the magnitude scale for earthquakes. While the island that once hosted Krakatoa was completely destroyed in the eruption, new eruptions beginning in December 1927 built the Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) cone in the center of the caldera produced by the 1883 eruption.
For a list of large recorded eruptions in recent history, see List of large volcanic eruptions. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the largest eruption since 1912, is dwarfed by the eruptions in this list. In a volcanic eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure.
See a satellite view of the Yellowstone caldera. Geologists estimate that 2 million years ago a cataclysmic series of volcanic eruptions in the Yellowsone Caldera was 2,500 times more powerful than the Mt. St. Helens eruption and perhaps was the largest, most violent volcanic eruption in the history of earth. 
The biggest eruption was at Yellowstone about 2.2 million years ago. An explosive eruption produced 2,500 cubic kilometers of ash ! (Thatâ€™s about 2,500 times more ash than Mount St. Helens erupted!). Yellowstone has had three very large eruptions in the last 2 million years. These eruptions occurred 2.2, 1.2, and 0.6 million years ago. Only four eruptions in the last 10,000 years have been assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7. They are: 1  Tambora, Indonesia 1815. 2  Baitoushan, China-Korea border, about 1050.
Confidence votes 700. In recent history, the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora has been the most violent volcanic eruption and also the most deadly, killing 92,000 people. This eruption also resulted in a major climatic change, causing what was known as The Year Without a Summer. The highest ranking on the volcanic scale is VEI 8; These are super eruptions. Yellow Stone and Lake Toba caldera were both VEI8's and Tambora was a VEI 7. But the Siberian traps would have been far off the scale. The Siberian traps were likely responsible for a mass extinction: the death of 95% of all life on Earth.
They are at least a thousand times larger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which produced only 1 km 3 (0.2 cu mi) of material, and at least six times larger than the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, the largest eruption in recent history, which produced 160 km 3 (38 cu mi) of volcanic deposits. In a volcanic eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure.
According to the USGS, it is the largest known eruption since the Ordovician era, between 504 and 438 million years ago. It was so large, in fact, that in a 2004 report in the Bulletin of Volcanology, scientists recommended adding a ninth level to the VEI scale, and declared the La Garita eruption a magnitude 9.2. It's a logarithmic scale that runs from 1 to 8. A magnitude 1 eruption spews less than 350,000 cubic feet (10,000 cubic meters) of volcanic tephra, which consists of ash and rocks; a magnitude 8 eruption puts out more than 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) of the stuff.
The Largest Volcano Eruptions-John Seach. The size of volcanic eruptions is determined by the amount of lava emitted. The largest eruption over the past 2 centuries was Tambora in Indonesia in 1815. Large volcanic eruptions are more frequent than asteroid impacts of similar magnitude. Table 1. Large eruptions in past 10,000 years.
