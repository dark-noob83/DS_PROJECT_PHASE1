This molecule is used in photosynthesis, as a photoreceptor 20. Photoreceptors absorb light energy, and chlorophyll specifically absorbs energy from sunlight 15. Chlorophyll makes plants and algae appear green because it reflects the green wavelengths found in sunlight, while absorbing all other colors. However, chlorophyll is not actually a single molecule. Despite their ability to conduct photosynthesis for energy, blue-green algae are a type of bacteria. This means that they are single-celled, prokaryotic (simple) organisms. Prokaryotic means that the cyanobacteria do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles within their cell wall 5.
The reflected colors are what give pigments their color. Chlorophyll pigments are green because they reflect green light. There are different types of chlorophyll (chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, chlorophyll-c1, chlorophyll-c2, chlorophyll-d, divinyl chlorophyll-a). Answer 2: Chlorophyll is a green pigment that gives most plants their color.The reason that it is green is because it absorbs other colors of light such as red and blue, so in a way the green light is reflected out since the pigment does not absorb it.
When sunlight returns in the spring and summer, the plants flourish in high concentrations. Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is a term used for several closely related green pigments found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Its name is derived from the Greek words χλωρός, chloros (green) and φύλλον, phyllon (leaf). Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues. Chlorophyll was first isolated and named by Joseph Bienaime Bienaimé caventou And Pierre Joseph pelletier in. 1817
Land plants (and plants in the ocean, called algae) have a lot of chlorophyll-a pigment because it is essential to photosynthesis, but they also have other pigments, called accessory pigments, that help them absorb light. Answer 2: Chlorophyll is a green pigment that gives most plants their color.The reason that it is green is because it absorbs other colors of light such as red and blue, so in a way the green light is reflected out since the pigment does not absorb it.
Chlorophyll B is mainly found in land plants, aquatic plants and green algae 1. In most of these organisms, the ratio of chlorophyll A to chlorophyll B is 3:1 21. Due to the presence of this molecule, some organizations will group the green algae into the Plant Kingdom. Despite their ability to conduct photosynthesis for energy, blue-green algae are a type of bacteria. This means that they are single-celled, prokaryotic (simple) organisms. Prokaryotic means that the cyanobacteria do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles within their cell wall 5.
Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, which allows plants to absorb energy from light. Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around photosystems that are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. In these complexes, chlorophyll serves two primary functions. Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues. Chlorophyll was first isolated and named by Joseph Bienaime Bienaimé caventou And Pierre Joseph pelletier in. 1817
Chlorophyll is not the only photosynthetic pigment found in algae and phytoplankton. There are also carotenoids,and phycobilins (biliproteins). These accessory pigments are responsible for other organism colors, such as yellow, red, blue and brown. Despite their ability to conduct photosynthesis for energy, blue-green algae are a type of bacteria. This means that they are single-celled, prokaryotic (simple) organisms. Prokaryotic means that the cyanobacteria do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles within their cell wall 5.
1 A characteristic of red algae is that their plastids contain only one type of chlorophyll -- chlorophyll a. 2  This is different from Green algae and plants which have both chlorophyll a and b. 3  Dinoflagellates these evolved on a separate line that includes, surprisingly, the ciliated protists. 
All plants, algae, and cyanobacteria which photosynthesize contain chlorophyll a. A second kind of chlorophyll is chlorophyll b, which occurs only in green algae and in the plants. A third form of chlorophyll which is common is (not surprisingly) called chlorophyll c, and is found only in the photosynthetic members of the Chromista as well as the dinoflagellates. More important than their reflection of light is the ability of pigments to absorb certain wavelengths. Because they interact with light to absorb only certain wavelengths, pigments are useful to plants and other autotrophs --organisms which make their own food using photosynthesis.
Other Pigments. There are other pigments found in algae that are similar to chlorophyll, though they do not directly capture sunlight. One example is carotenoid, which is a brown pigment (and is found in brown algae which, similar to dinoflagellates, can cause an algal bloom). Additionally, some types of algae have chlorophyllin and phycobilins, which are water-soluble salt derived from chlorophyll used to help capture sunlight (though photosynthesis does not occur in either one), and which are also found in the chloroplast.
