The U.S. Food Code (2008) identifies potentially hazardous foods as raw or cooked animal foods (meat, fish, poultry, dairy, eggs); heat treated plant foods (cooked vegetables, baked potatoes, texturized vegetable protein); cut melon; garlic-in-oil that has not been acidified; raw bean sprouts; and cut tomatoes.
Most states have adopted the FDA Food Code definition of potentially hazardous foods or the previous FDA/AFDO Retail Code or FDA Food Service Code, which do not state a specific a w or pH value, but use a general definition that has been interpreted by the FDA as including a w = 0.85 and pH =4.6.
Define potentially hazardous food.. A potentially hazardous food is a natural or synthetic food that needs to be held at 41°F or colder or 135°F or hotter because it is in a form capable of supporting: 1  the rapid and progressive growth of infectious or toxigenic bacteria. 2  the growth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum or.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Potentially Hazardous Food is a term used by food safety organizations to classify foods that require time-temperature control to keep them safe for human consumption.

Potentially hazardous foods include foods of animal origin that are raw or heat-treated, a food of plant origin that is heat-treated or consists of raw seed sprouts, cut melons, and garlic-in-oil mixtures that have not been properly acidified to prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria.
Cut Leafy Greens-Following 24 multi-state outbreaks between 1998 and 2008, cut leafy greens was added to the definition of potentially hazardous food requiring time-temperature control for safety (TCS). The term used in the definition includes a variety of cut lettuces and leafy greens.
