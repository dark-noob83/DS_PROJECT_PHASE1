The hops used to make beer are the flower of the hop vine, which is a member of the hemp family (Cannabaceae).

Read on... Hops are one of the basic ingredients in beer brewing-the others being grain, yeast, and water. The hops we use in brewing is actually the flower of the hop plant, which is a member of the hemp family. The hops in the picture above are compressed pellets of hops flowers used specifically for beer brewing. Hops contain an essential oil with a very bitter flavor.
Hops are the female flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the hop plant Humulus lupulus. They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, to which they impart a bitter, tangy flavor, though they are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine.
Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as dry hopping, which contributes to the hop aroma. The three major components of the essential oil of hops are myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene, which comprise about 60â€“80% of the oil for most hop varieties.
Hops provide bitterness to balance the sweetness of Malt when making beer, adds flavoring oils and aromas, and also helps to stabilize and preserve beer. Hops used in brewing comes from the flowers of a plant called Humulus lupulus. The hop plant is a perrenial spiraling vine that requires most soil.
