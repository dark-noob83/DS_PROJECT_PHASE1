This is my 3rd Brixton, and it is every bit as awesome as my other two. First, size consistency, for me, has been spot on. I own the Gain felt fedora, the Brood and now Hooligan, both in brown/khaki herringbone, all three fit very consistently. Second, the quality just simply far exceeds the price you pay. Style: Rated:5 stars! Awesome hat! Brixton makes a high quality hat that looks great. I originally ordered a XL which was too big but the Zappos exchange process was quick and easy and my large showed up the next day. I also bought the Brixton Hooligan which is a nice looking hat as well.
