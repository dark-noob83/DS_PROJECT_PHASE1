The average annual costs of providing water services for a household are €594. Given the 8.2% cut made by the CER, the average annual water and wastewater charge for all types of households is €238. The Commission said: Not all households are the same size, or use water in the same way; some will use more, some less.
The average bill in my area for a family of 4 in a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house with pressurized irrigation for the yards is probably about $30-40. No idea for 1 person in a 1 bedroom, though. Part of the bill is taxes, etc, and doesn't scale down, so I'd say maybe $15-20.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The average price varies depend on the state you're in. In east coast, the average price is about $10 per household member. Again it also varies on the usage of water. The average water bill for one person will average around 30 dollars a month. Much depends on where you live and whether sewer is included in the bill.
In some buildings, if you have a gas range, you’ll have to pay for the natural gas that you use during cooking. (And in some buildings, the natural gas will also provide your heat.) With cooking, the cost is minimal — $15 a month at most, usually quite a lot less. It really all depends how much you cook at home.
