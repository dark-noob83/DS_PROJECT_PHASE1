To determine your RDA for protein, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use this online protein calculator. For a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds woman and who is sedentary (doesn’t exercise), that translates into 53 grams of protein a day. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements.
Boys of the same age need an average of 2,000 calories each day, so protein should account for 200 to 600 of their calories. Boys and girls 9 to 13 need the same .95 grams of protein for each kilogram of body weight, making the recommended dietary allowance for kids in this range 34 grams per day. The Institute of Medicine recommends kids between the ages of one and three eat enough protein to account for 5 to 20 percent of their total calorie intake each day. For a moderately active child who averages 1,200 calories per day, between 60 and 240 of those calories should come from protein sources. More specifically, kids between 1 and 3 should consume 1.1 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight each day. The recommended dietary allowance, the amount necessary to meet the needs of 97 to 98 percent of healthy kids in this age group, is 13
Food consumption surveys show an average protein intake of approximately 100 grams per day (regardless of body type, sex, or exercise levels), with about 70% of that from high fat animal products. Most people could do with significantly less protein per day (about 45-55 grams per day is adequate for most). 
I consume around 300 grams protein per day and it is working well with my weight training/body building program. I eat 6 meals per day and shoot for 40-50 grams of protein per each meal. On my work out days, I consume around 150-200 grams of carbs and on my non-work out days I drop the carbs to around 100 grams.
The recommended percentage of protein remains the same -- 10 to 30 percent of daily calories -- for those ages 9 to 13. Moderately active girls should eat an average of 1,800 calories per day and 180 to 540 of those calories should come from protein sources. The Institute of Medicine recommends kids between the ages of one and three eat enough protein to account for 5 to 20 percent of their total calorie intake each day. For a moderately active child who averages 1,200 calories per day, between 60 and 240 of those calories should come from protein sources. More specifically, kids between 1 and 3 should consume 1.1 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight each day. The recommended dietary allowance, the amount necessary to meet the needs of 97 to 98 percent of healthy kids in this age group, is 13 grams per day
How Much You Weigh. Another, more specific, way to calculate your protein needs is based on body weight. The current recommendation is to consume 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of body weight. Using this formula, a 150-pound person would need approximately 55 grams of protein, while a 120-pound person would need 44 grams. 
This is just what I consider to be a good minimum daily protein intake for general health/function. 0.5-0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Average healthy adult (male or female) that IS doing some form of exercise regularly or IS trying to improve their body (lose fat, build muscle, etc.). This is the minimum I’d recommend in this case. 0.8-1 grams of protein per pound of body weight
As a general rule, between 10 percent and 15 percent of your total calories should come from protein. So, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, at least 200 should come from protein, or about 50 grams. You should try to eat around one gram of protein per one kilogram of body weight, or around 0.4 grams per pound. An easier way to figure this out in your head is to take your weight, divide it in half, and subtract 10. The total will be the number of grams of protein you should consume each day.
Adults in the U.S. are encouraged to get 10% to 35% of their day's calories from protein foods. That's about 46 grams of protein for women, and 56 grams of protein for men.
