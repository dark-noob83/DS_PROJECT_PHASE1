1 Re-piping an average house with 1- to 2-1/2 bathrooms can cost $1,500-$15,000 or more, depending on the size of the house and the type of new pipes being installed (plastic or copper). 1 Re-piping a house with plastic pipes -- either PEX (flexible plastic tubing made of cross-linked polyethylene) or CPVC (rigid plastic pipes made of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) -- typically costs $1,500-$8,000 or more, depending on the number of fixtures.
1 Re-piping a small 1-bathroom home with PEX might cost $1,500-$2,500; a 3-bedroom, 2-1/2-bathroom, two-story home might be $5,000-$7,000 or more. 2  For example, Repipe1 in California will re-pipe a 2-bathroom home with PEX starting at $3,499, with the walls left paint-ready. 1 Specialized tools are required to cut PEX tubing, install connections and check the tightness of crimped connections. 2  These can cost $50-$200 each, depending on size and type; a basic PEX tool kit typically costs about $90-$150. 3  Get several estimates. 4  Ask about the plumber's experience with PEX
1 Although there have been problems with pinhole leaks in areas with acidic water, for many plumbers copper remains the premium pipe material. 2  The price of copper has increased dramatically in recent years, and re-plumbing a house with copper can cost $2,500-$15,000 or more. 1 Re-piping a house with plastic pipes -- either PEX (flexible plastic tubing made of cross-linked polyethylene) or CPVC (rigid plastic pipes made of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) -- typically costs $1,500-$8,000 or more, depending on the number of fixtures.
1 The price of copper has increased dramatically in recent years, and re-plumbing a house with copper can cost $2,500-$15,000 or more. 2  For example, Pete Rodriguez of Atlantic Re-Plumbing says a 2-1/2-bathroom house that costs $3,700 to re-plumb with CPVC would start at $4,500 in copper, and could cost more. 1 Re-piping a house with plastic pipes -- either PEX (flexible plastic tubing made of cross-linked polyethylene) or CPVC (rigid plastic pipes made of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) -- typically costs $1,500-$8,000 or more, depending on the number of fixtures.
1 Plumbing a new home using PEX for the water supply lines can cost $5,000-$21,000 or more depending on location, the size of the house and the number of fixtures, or typically about $2,000-$5,000 less than using copper pipes. 1 Specialized tools are required to cut PEX tubing, install connections and check the tightness of crimped connections. 2  These can cost $50-$200 each, depending on size and type; a basic PEX tool kit typically costs about $90-$150. 3  Get several estimates. 4  Ask about the plumber's experience with PEX
1 PEX piping costs around $.50 to $2.00 per foot, while copper piping averages $2 to $4 per foot. 2  Replacing only exposed piping can reduce the project cost by as much as 50 to 60 percent. 3  Pipe replacement during a renovation results in even greater savings. 1 By selling your old metal piping for scrap youâ€™ll be able to recoup some, if not most, of the cost of new plumbing. 2  Replacing the existing plumbing with copper pipes in an average-sized, 2-batroom home costs $7,500 to $15,000.
1 At Repipe1, Danny Zilberberg says a 2-bathroom house that costs $3,499 in PEX would be more than $5,000 with copper. 2  And Tony Prados of MasterServ says a 2-1/2-bathroom slab foundation house that is $4,000-$5,000 in PEX would be $5,000-$6,000 with copper pipes. 1 Re-piping a house with plastic pipes -- either PEX (flexible plastic tubing made of cross-linked polyethylene) or CPVC (rigid plastic pipes made of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) -- typically costs $1,500-$8,000 or more, depending on the number of fixtures.
1 Re-plumbing a house (installing new lines and abandoning the old ones) with PEX can cost $1,500-$8,000 or more. 2  Re-plumbing costs are typically based on the number of fixtures, with each sink, bathtub, shower, toilet, dishwasher, water heater, etc. counting as one fixture. 1 Specialized tools are required to cut PEX tubing, install connections and check the tightness of crimped connections. 2  These can cost $50-$200 each, depending on size and type; a basic PEX tool kit typically costs about $90-$150. 3  Get several estimates. 4  Ask about the plumber's experience with PEX
Cost of PEX materials and installation to replace galvanized. I read the thread regarding 1/2 vs. 3/4 size for residential water supply lines and it got me wondering how much it would cost for my in-laws to replace their galvanized plumbing with PEX (or copper for that matter). I was thinking, the cost of the PEX tube was like getting a $60 ink jet printer, with replacement ink cartridges for $65 ... They got their money back.
