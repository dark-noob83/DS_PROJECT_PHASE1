The surface of the brain has fissures or folds to increase the surface area for the cortex. Dumber animals such as rats have smooth brains. Much of the work carried out in the brain is performed by the top few layers of cells, a lot of the brainâ€™s volume is, in effect, point-to-point wiring.
Cerebral Convolutions: The reason your cerebral cortex has so many folds, like a wrinkled up walnut, is that there is a limited amount of space inside your skull. By wrinkling up, the cortex creates more space to fit in more neurons.
Share. The cerebral cortex is the layer of the brain often referred to as gray matter. The cortex (thin layer of tissue) is gray because nerves in this area lack the insulation that makes most other parts of the brain appear to be white. The cortex covers the outer portion (1.5mm to 5mm) of the cerebrum and cerebellum.
Cerebral Cortex The cerebral cortex is the outer surface of the cerebral hemispheres. It is the highest level of the brain and has about 20 billion neurons in the human brain which carry out the highest levels of mental functioning. The cerebral cortex is a layer of grey matter up to about 1/2 cm thick.
This is where the wrinkles come in. The surface of your brain is called the cortex, and the cortex is the part of your brain that contains your neurons. The more surface your brain has, the more cortex it has. The more cortex it has, the more neurons it has. The more neurons it has, the smarter it is.
