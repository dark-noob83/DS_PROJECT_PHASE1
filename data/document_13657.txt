Nanoscale approaches for highway research (Fact Sheet) by Public Roads. Polymer composites and nano-reinforced materials -- combining wood-based materials with. materials to develop new or improved composite materials with unique multifunctional properties.
(Image: Centers for Disease Control). Nanotechnology involves a new and broad science where diverse fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering converge at the nanoscale. It is also important to understand that nanoscale materials are found in nature.
At nanometer size. Any device only a few nanometers in size is nanoscale. Nanotechnology is said to comprise elements less than 100 nanometers in size (100 nm). See nanotechnology and nanometer.
Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Physicist Richard Feynman, the father of nanotechnology.

You may recall from the Size of the Nanoscale page that the nanoscale is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Working at the nanoscale requires an understanding of the various types and dimensions of nanoscale materials. Different types of nanomaterials are named for their individual shapes and dimensions.
Part of the Hardware glossary: Nanoscale technology is a branch of nanotechnology in which standard size tools are used to manufacture simple structures and devices with dimensions on the order of a few nanometer s or less, where one nanometer (1 nm) is equal to a billionth of a meter (10 -9 m).
