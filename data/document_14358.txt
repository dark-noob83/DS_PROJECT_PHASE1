As the amount of collagen in the skin decreases with age a Collagen supplement helps maintain body collagen levels.**. Collagen helps maintain bones and joints .**. Collagen forms the supporting structure for connective tissue such as bone, teeth, skin and joints.**. Collagen is a protein in cartilage that helps form a “cushion” around bones and joints.**. Ultra hydrolyzed collagen provides amino acids that can be used for energy.**.
It has recently been shown by Myllyla and his colleagues that, one molecule of vitamin C is destroyed for each H (hydrogen atom) replaced by OH (during the formation of collagen)... Vitamin C, in the critical reactions that assemble collagen in the tissues, does not serve merely as a catalyst but is destroyed.. Linus Pauling. We have come upon reasons why we require for good health so much larger amounts of vitamin C than are present in the plants we use as food... 
1 Collagen is most commonly found within the body in the skin, bones and connective tissues. 2  The word collagen is derived from the Greek kolla, meaning glue. 3  Collagen gives the skin its strength and structure, and also plays a role in the replacement of dead skin cells. 1 Protein makes up around 20% of the body's mass, and collagen makes up around 30% of the protein in the human body. 2  There are at least 16 types of collagen, but 80-90% of the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and III. 3  Type I collagen fibrils are stronger than steel (gram for gram).
Collagen, the very substance that these supplements are trying to support, keeps skin resilient and joints working smoothly and provides the structure in the tissue that connects our organs—but past the ripe old age of 30, everyone's collagen production declines. Stop us if this sounds familiar: You're in the drugstore vitamin aisle, staring at the vast and confounding array of collagen supplements, all touting miracles for skin and joint health.
Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen /ˈkɒlədʒɨn/ is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues in animals. As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content
Fruits such as oranges, strawberries and red peppers also contain Vitamin C, something that is key for the optimum condition of the skin. Vegetables such as broccoli, leafy greens and cauliflower provide our skin with glucosinolates, which fight the free radicals that attack our collagen. The truth is, however, that there is little to no evidence that beauty supplements, pills and drinks can do what they claim. Collagen is a type of protein which when ingested, is broken down by the digestive system into individual amino acids to be recombined by cells according to their needs.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is the substance that holds the whole body together. 1 Protein makes up around 20% of the body's mass, and collagen makes up around 30% of the protein in the human body. 2  There are at least 16 types of collagen, but 80-90% of the collagen in the body consists of types I, II, and III. 3  Type I collagen fibrils are stronger than steel (gram for gram).
Collagen is a natural protein component of the skin that acts like a scaffold and the main building block for cells, tissues and organs. About a third of the protein content in your body is made up of collagen, which is found in the bones, muscles, and tissues of the organs. Collagen, keratin and elastin give the skin its strength, elasticity and structure. The body naturally produces the collagen that it needs, but this production is gradually disrupted as part of the natural aging process. Women produce less collagen than men, and this collagen is lost at a rate of about 1% per year. The truth is, however, that there is little to no evidence that beauty supplements, pills and drinks can do what they claim. Collagen is a type of protein which when ingested, is broken down by the digestive system into individual amino acids to be recombined by cells according to their needs.
