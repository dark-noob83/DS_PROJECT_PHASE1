To clarify, only software that is created specifically for the DSi will be region locked. This will include both download and cartridge-based games.
skrilla88 posted...DSL is not region lock. DSi and XL is.This is only a part truth-the DSi and XL are region locked only for DSi-Enhanced games. The vast majority of DS games are normal ones that can be played on any DS system (apart from the Chinese one). There aren't many DSi-Enhanced games around, but there are some notable ones such as Pokemon Black and White.
According to the company: DSi software (software that is only compatible with DSi) is region locked, eg: European DSi software can only be played on European DSi consoles... Nintendo DS software however is region free so you can play any DS software on DSi from any region.
Like the original Nintendo 3DS, the Nintendo 3DS XL is region locked. In other words, if you buy your Nintendo 3DS XL system in North America, you should buy your games in North American markets. Japanese games and European games will not work properly on a North American 3DS XL, if they even work at all.
Nintendo: DSi software is region locked [CVG]. While Nintendo has announced the DSi for Japan this November, the company is holding its release elsewhere. Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has stated that the newest DS iteration won't be released in the U.S. until late 2009.
