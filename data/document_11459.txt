1 The mean of a set of numbers is their average. 2  You find the average of a set of numbers by adding them up and dividing by the number of numbers you have.
The mean is the average of the numbers: a calculated central value of a set of numbers. To calculate: Just add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.
1 For example, in the set of numbers {4,6,25}, the median is 6. 2  However the numbers must be in order for the median to be in the middle. 3  If there are an even number of numbers, then the median is the average of the last 2 middle numbers.
You can figure out the mean by adding up all the numbers in the data and then dividing by the number of numbers. For example, if you have 12 numbers, you add them up and divide by 12. This would give you the mean of the data. Median-The median is the middle number of the data set.
The mean is the average you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The median is the middle value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order, so you may have to rewrite your list first.
Step 5: Take answer and that is the mean! Mean=2. you add all of your numbers together and then dividing them by the number of terms (in other words the number of numbers.). An arithmetic mean, or just mean for short, is an average

For a data set, the terms arithmetic mean, mathematical expectation, and sometimes average are used synonymously to refer to a central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values.
