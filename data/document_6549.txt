Ratio of per capita caloric intake of China to the 10 countries with the highest per capita income increased from 70% in 1980 to 91% in 2011. Stated alternatively, China has reduced the gap that existed in 1980 by 70% ((91%-70%)/30%). China's per capita consumption of animal protein increased from 11% to 60% of per capita consumption in the 10 countries with the highest per capita income between 1980 and 2011. Thus, China has reduced the gap that existed in 1980 by 55% ((60%-11%)/89%)
The calculations in the report suggest that China will continue to increase its per capita income more rapidly than that of the U.S. for at least four decades. By sometime around 2060, China’s citizens will be earning close to half of what U.S. citizens earn. 
Maddison historical data covers population by country, GDP and GDP per capita back to 1820. This data is grouped by region and can be downloaded for the last 30 years or in it's entirety: Downloadable Data: Europe-last 30 years: Population-GDP-GDP Per capita. 
India’s per capita income was $550 and China’s $600 in 1500. The Arab world had declined. But standards of living in Western Europe at that time had already gone far ahead. Italy topped the table, with a per capita income of $1,100, the Netherlands following with a per capita income of $761. Dutch per capita income was $1,381 in 1600, while Britain in Shakespeare’s time had a per capita income of $974. Recall that 1600 was the year the East India Company was founded. In contrast, India’s per capita income continued to be $550, while China’s was $600. Note that even Ireland, one of the poorest of Western Europe’s countries, had a per capita income of $615, higher than India’s and China’s
But adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP), China surpassed Japan and become the world's second largest economy as early as 2002. From 1979 until 2010, China's average annual GDP growth was 9.91%, reaching an historical high of 15.2% in 1984 and a record low of 3.8% in 1990. This article also includes historical GDP growth.

The divergence in food consumption is consistent with the divergence in per capita income. After adjusting for purchasing power parity, per capita income in China was 47% lower in 1980 than in India but 118% higher in 2013. In essence, the ratio of China to India inverted over 43 years, underscoring the more rapid increase of per capita income in China than in India (see Figure 5). Stated alternatively, China has reduced the gap that existed in 1980 by 70% ((91%-70%)/30%). China's per capita consumption of animal protein increased from 11% to 60% of per capita consumption in the 10 countries with the highest per capita income between 1980 and 2011.
That is what is brought out by Maddison’s estimates of GDP per capita, again in PPP terms in 1990 dollars. In 1 AD, India’s GDP per capita was $450, as was China’s. But Italy under the Roman Empire had a per capita income of $809. In 1000 AD, India’s per capita income was $450 and China’s $466. Dutch per capita income was $1,381 in 1600, while Britain in Shakespeare’s time had a per capita income of $974. Recall that 1600 was the year the East India Company was founded. In contrast, India’s per capita income continued to be $550, while China’s was $600. Note that even Ireland, one of the poorest of Western Europe’s countries, had a per capita income of $615, higher than India’s and China’s
