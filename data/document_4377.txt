Basalt is fine-grained so that the individual minerals are not visible, but they include pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar and olivine. These minerals are visible in the coarse-grained, plutonic version of basalt called gabbro.
Basalt. Basalt is a very common dark-colored volcanic rock composed of calcic plagioclase (usually labradorite), clinopyroxene (augite) and iron ore (titaniferous magnetite). Basalt may also contain olivine, quartz, hornblende, nepheline, orthopyroxene, etc. Basalt is a volcanic equivalent of gabbro.
Basalt is a dark-colored, fine-grained, igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals. It most commonly forms as an extrusive rock, such as a lava flow, but can also form in small intrusive bodies, such as an igneous dike or a thin sill. It has a composition similar to gabbro.
Basalt a mafic extrusive rock, is the most widespread of all igneous rocks, and comprises more than 90% of all volcanic rocks. Because of its relatively low silica content, basalt lava has a comparatively low viscosity, and forms thin flows that can travel long distances. It is also found as intrusive dikes and sills.
Basalt Rocks. Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is very dark in color. It is the most common type of rock in the Earth's crust and it makes up most of the ocean floor. It is made of many dark colored minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt also contains some light colored minerals such as feldspar and quartz, but the amounts are small. Typically, you can't see most of the mineral crystals without using a microscope because quick cooling prevents large crystals from forming.
The most abundant minerals in granite are potassium feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, and quartz; with differing amounts of muscovite, biotite, and hornblende-type amphiboles. â€¦ The most abundant minerals in basalt are amphibole and pyroxene, sometimes plagioclase, feldspathoids, and/or olivine.
