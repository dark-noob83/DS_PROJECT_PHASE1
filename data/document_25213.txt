Sand prices vary considerably depending on the type of sand and on your location, running anywhere from $5 a ton to $20 a ton, delivered. So creating a two-inch surface for a small dressage arena (66 feet by 131 feet) - based on an estimated need of 70 tons-would cost somewhere between $350 and $1,400. When determining your sand needs, be sure to enlist the help of the quarry you're buying from.
At a pound per square foot, it will cost about 15 to 20 cents for each square foot in your arena. So, for example, adding a pound per square foot to a small dressage arena is likely to cost somewhere between $1,300 and $1,740; a large dressage arena (66 feet by 198 feet) would run from about $1,950 to $2,600.
A polymerized sand installed in a small dressage arena could run from $35,000 to $60,000. Additives Once you settle on a primary footing material, you may find that it works greatâ€¦ except. Stone dust works great except it needs a bit more bounce. Sand works great except it shifts too much.
Arena Length(ft) x Arena Width(ft) x Desired depth of sand(in)/324 = Cubic yards of sand needed. Cubic yards of sand needed x 1.3 = tons of sand needed. So for a standard arena (about 198 x 66) with 2 inches of sand that's about, 105 tons of sand which is a little over 4 full sized dump trucks.
I'm building a 20 x 60 m arena but trying to keep costs down. I'm putting in hard base of compacted clay with sand over it. I'm not going to the expense of gravel base as this ring won't get much work.
Place two inches of footing in a glass jar, fill with water and stir vigorously for about a minute. Within 60 seconds, the sand will settle to the bottom. You can measure the depth of this layer to determine how much sand is in your footing.
It is a layer of gravel, then a layer of cheap, fill type sand, a layer of some sort of carpet stuff that prevents the lower layers from mixing with the next layer which is stonedust compacted to the firmness of asphalt. Finally I have 2 inches of angular sand. My arena drains within an hour after huge rainstorms.
