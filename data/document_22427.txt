Prep Time: 5 Minutes Cook Time: about 20 Minutes Ready in: 25 Minutes Makes 3 servings Ingredients: 1 1/2 lbs boneless and skinless chicken thighs 1/2 cup of honey 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon rosemary 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper Directions: 1. Pre-heat oven broiler.

3. Place the chicken thighs on a broiler pan and broil, turning occasionally and basting with the honey glaze, 20 minutes or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh registers 180°F. Note: Do not baste during the last 5 minutes of grilling.
Toss the chicken with the baking sauce. Spread the chicken in the baking dish. No need to grease the dish. Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments.
