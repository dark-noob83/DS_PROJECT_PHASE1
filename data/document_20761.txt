When narrators work on an hourly basis, it is PER FINISHED HOUR of audio, not per actual hours worked. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, it takes AT LEAST 2 hours (and sometimes up to 4 hours if there are a lot of voices, accents, or other challenges) of studio time to record 1 hour of finished audio.
Veteran or experienced narrators can expect to earn $168.25 per hour or $1,346 for a finished audio book of eight hours. Conversely, non-union narrators with experience may earn between $90 and $250 per finished hour. However, it is more typical for the ceiling to be $150 per hour for a non-union narrator.
The narrator working at home either must do them or pay another professional to do them. A book with a 10-hour finished time therefore may require 60 hours in real time to create. You can use the word count to estimate the the finished time as described in this article about determining your rate.
However, there is some data that reflects the salary of audio book narrators by city. According to Indeed.com, those working in New York City and Los Angeles (the two most prominent cities for audio book work) earn an average of $43,000 and $39,000 respectively.
