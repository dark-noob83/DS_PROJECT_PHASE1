The epiglottis is a flap that is made of elastic cartilage tissue covered with a mucous membrane, attached to the entrance of the larynx. It projects obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the hyoid bone, pointing dorsally. The epiglottis is shaped like a leaf, with the stem attached to the anterior part of the thyroid cartilage. The epiglottis is one of nine cartilaginous structures that make up the larynx (voice box). During breathing, it lies completely within
The function of the epiglottis is to block off food and liquids from entering the trachea (windpipe). Allows air to pass through larynx into the rest of the respiratory system.

The epiglottis is a flexible flap at the superior end of the larynx in the throat. It acts as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus to permit air to enter the airway to the lungs and food to pass into the gastrointestinal tract. In its relaxed position, the epiglottis projects into the pharynx, or throat, and rests just posterior to the tongue. Viewed from the posterior direction, it is shaped like a teardrop with a wide, rounded region at the superior end and a narrow tapered point at its inferior end....
The epiglottis is a structure found in the throat. Specifically, it's located behind the tongue and above the larynx. Elastic cartilage forms this thin, teardrop-shaped flap. A mucous membrane coats the epiglottis. The side facing the mouth is covered in cells similar to those in the rest of the mouth, whereas the backside is covered with cells resembling those of the larynx. The epiglottis is held in place by two ligaments.

Epiglottis: Definition and Function. “Epi” means above and “glottis” pertains to the tongue. From these terms, we can derive its definition and location. Epiglottis is a flap of tissue found at the most superior part of the larynx. It is anchored by the epiglottic cartilage which is an elastic type. It acts as a gatekeeper who closes and protects the gate (airway) from the outsiders (foods and drinks) and directs it into the proper direction (esophagus)
