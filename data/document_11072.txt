Fossilized bones were originally discovered in Mongolia. The Earth of the Cretaceous was similar to Earth as we know it today. The position of modern day Mongolia was the same as Mongolia of the late Cretaceous. Velociraptor was a terrestrial creature that lived in a dry desert with sand dunes. The Velociraptor lived during the same time period as the Protoceratops, Oviraptor, and the flightless bird Mononykus. Its main competition came from a relative of Troodon, Saurornithoides.
Oviraptors (name meaning egg thief) are native to Mongolia. They are commonly found in the Gobi Desert, and according to the evidence they likely lived in a dry sandy environment. They lived along the velociraptor (quick thief, as discovered by Roy Chapman Andrews himself.
Researchers announcing a newly described dinosaur called it the “chicken from hell,” “hell’s chicken” and “scary as well as absurd.”. More prosaically known as Anzu wyliei, the beaked dinosaur stood about ten feet tall and more than 11 feet long with a tall crest on its head and sharp claws.
Oviraptor is traditionally depicted with a distinctive crest, similar to that of the cassowary. However, re-examination of several oviraptorids (Clark, Norell & Barsbold, 2001) show that this well-known dinosaur may actually be a species of Citipati, a relative of Oviraptor.
Oviraptor may have eaten eggs. However, in 1977, Barsbold argued that the strength of its beak would indicate that it was strong enough to break the shells of mollusks such as clams, which are found in the same formation as Oviraptor.
