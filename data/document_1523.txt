Jack Russells often live to be 16 years old, and stay active right up until the end of their lives. One Jack Russell living in California is 17 years old, and her owners claim she has as much energy as she had when she was a puppy. The activity level of the average Jack Russell Terrier is about 10 times that of the average Labrador Retriever, for example. Labs like to run and have fun, but eventually they do sack out on the living room floor.
Dog Size. Research shows that larger dogs live for a shorter period of time when compared to smaller ones. For example, an Irish Wolfhound (average 115 lbs) has an average lifespan of 7 years, while a Jack Russell Terrier (average 15 lbs) can live up to 13-16 years. Chihauhuas are normally referred to as the breed with the longest lifespan. They average 15-20 years and are one of the smallest dog breeds. The oldest Chihuahua on record 1, Megabyte, died at the age of 20 years and 265 days.
