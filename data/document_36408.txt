1 On average, an air conditioning unit can cost anywhere from $400 to as much as $5,000. 2  This is not going to include the price of installing it. 3  For example, a house that is anywhere from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet will need an air conditioner that will provide enough power to cool each room. 1 An air conditioning unit is capable of providing cold air to different sized rooms, and this depends on the capacity of the air conditioner; the higher power output the unit has, the more expensive it will be. 2 
1 For a 1,000 square foot home, the cost of an HVAC system is $6,000 to $12,000, including a new furnace, air conditioning unit, and ductwork. 2  For larger homes and more complex setups, however, the price could be significantly higher. 1 For central air-conditioning, you’ll pay $3,000 to $5,000 and up for a 2,000 square foot home. 2  A new furnace in a central heating system costs $2,500 to $7,500 or more.
The lower the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER), the more energy it takes to cool the home. The high-end system would cost Jeff $5,800, but for that $2,300 more, he got more features and optimum, 97 percent efficiency. Because the Wilsons mainly used their air conditioning to defuse the thick humidity typical in southeast Ohio during summer, a variable-speed blower was worth the investment. 
Split units do not require duct work, while packaged units do. Adding central air conditioning to a home with an existing forced-air heating system in a 2,000-square-foot house averages $3,000 - $4,000. If ducts need to be added, the cost can double, and a split unit is the way to go. As opposed to window units, a ductless system is quieter, and can also heat your home. 
1 Expect to pay $2,000-$5,000 to install a complete ductless mini-split air conditioning system in a 800-1,000-square foot home, or $5,000-$7,000 for a 2,000-square-foot house. 1 A ductless unit is a split system just like central air, only smaller and more flexible. 2  The compressor sits outdoors and is connected by a pair of refrigerated lines to one or more air handlers inside the house. 3  The hole in the wall for the lines varies, but is usually about 3 inches in diameter.
The price to install central air conditioner units with heating unit is between $6,500 and $15,000. The HVAC installation costs are for complete heating and cooling system and labor cost.

Central ac units with 5 tons and 18 seer rating would cost about 3 to 5 grand or even more.
The cost to install a window air conditioner averages between $150 and $300, depending on the size you need. Installing a window air conditioning unit can bring added comfort for a reasonable price, but it will be less powerful than a central air conditioning system. Many central air conditioning systems use the furnace blower to distribute cool air through the home. If you do not have a central heating system installed, it is cost-effective to install a heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system at the same time.
1 Most central air conditioning systems are a split system, with the heaviest, noisiest, heat-generating components installed outdoors, and an evaporator coil indoors. 2  The evaporator is connected to a blower (often part of a furnace) which distributes the chilled air through the home's vents. 
Most homeowners report spending between $3,675 and $7,155 to have air conditioning installed. This price is more typical of a central A/C unit installation rather than a window air conditioner addition which typically averages about $300. Your total cost for the job will depend on the type of system you choose. Many central air conditioning systems use the furnace blower to distribute cool air through the home. If you do not have a central heating system installed, it is cost-effective to install a heating and air conditioning (HVAC) system at the same time.
1 For a home of this size, the cost of an A/C unit can range from $2,800 to as much as $4,500 depending upon the brand. 2  Smaller homes that are less than 1,200 square feet, the air conditioner can be within the $400 to $1,500 price range. 1 An air conditioning unit is capable of providing cold air to different sized rooms, and this depends on the capacity of the air conditioner; the higher power output the unit has, the more expensive it will be. 2  On average, an air conditioning unit can cost anywhere from $400 to as much as $5,000.
