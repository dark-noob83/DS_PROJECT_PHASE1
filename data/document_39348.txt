The average cost for a private one-bedroom apartment in an assisted living residence is over $3,000 per month, according to research compiled by several nonprofit senior living organizations, including the Assisted Living Federation of America.
Crain’s noted this same trend in 2011, when Michigan’s annual cost of assisted living care was $36,000, a 12.3 percent annual increase since 2004. Genworth predicts the cost of assisted living to be $39,000 annually for 2015 in Michigan, with 5 percent growth over the next five years.
Whereas the average cost of skilled nursing care in Georgia is $6,500 monthly for a semi-private room, licensed personal care homes average less than half that amount – $2,818 for a private room, according to the 2011 MetLife Market Survey of Nursing Home, Assisted Living, Adult Day Services, and Home Care Costs.
Therefore the cost is usually higher than that of regular assisted living.According to Genworth.com, in 2014, the national average cost of memory care for a single resident was almost $5,000 per month. This cost does vary widely by community, however, and generally ranges from $2,000 to $7
Genworth Financial notes that the costs of assisted living has gone up more than nursing homes, adult day care and home care.

Assisted Living Costs by State. The Genworth 2015 Cost of Care Survey is the most comprehensive study of its kind. Genworth Financial surveyed approximatey 15% of assisted living communities. The monthly cost is for a one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility.

Fifty-nine percent of the assisted living communities surveyed provide Alzheimer’s and dementia care for residents, half (52%) of which charge an additional fee for this service. The national average monthly base rate for Alzheimer’s and dementia care is $4,435 ($53,220 annually).
Just as the cost of real estate varies by geographic area, assisted living costs also vary nationwide. In the 2015 Cost of Care Survey conducted by Genworth Financial, assisted living showed an increase of 2.86% compared to the 2014 costs and the national median monthly rate is $3,600.
