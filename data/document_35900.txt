Natural gas is one of the cleanest, safest, and most useful forms of energy in our day-to-day lives. Natural gas is a hydrocarbon, which means it is made up of compounds of hydrogen and carbon. The simplest hydrocarbon is methane; it contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.
Coal Gas Methane is often found in association with coal deposits. These deposits might be virgin coal seams (coal seam methane/coal bed methane), be in the process of being mined or may be abandoned. Gas from each of these may be suitable for the production of power.
COAL. Humans have been using coal as a fuel for hundreds or even thousands of years, and coal fueled steam engines in trains long before the liquid fuel-powered engines of todayâ€™s cars were in use. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

coal gas-gaseous mixture produced by distillation of bituminous coal and used for heating and lighting. town gas-coal gas manufactured for domestic and industrial use. fuel-a substance that can be consumed to produce energy; more fuel is needed during the winter months; they developed alternative fuels for aircraft.
Coal is a fossil fuel created from the remains of plants that lived and died about 100 to 400 million years ago when parts of the earth were covered with huge swampy forests. Coal is classified as a nonrenewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form.
Natural gas is found in coal seams hundreds of metres beneath the earth's surface. Just like conventional natural gas, coal seam gas (CSG) is comprised mostly of methane (CH 4) and is a type of petroleum that was formed from the compressed remains of plants over millions of years.
