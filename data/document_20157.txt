Red-tailed hawks are relatively long-lived birds. While many of these birds die young (most live less than two years), those that survive the first few years can live for many years. The oldest known wild red-tailed hawk lived to at least 21.5 years old. In captivity, red-tailed hawks have lived for at least 29.5 years. Red-tailed hawks play an important role in local ecosystems by helping to control the populations of small mammals, including rodents and rabbits. They also provide habitat for some small bird species, including house sparrows, that live in active red-tailed hawk nests.
1 Remove Feeders: If hawks are still a menace to your backyard birds, remove all birdfeeders and cease feeding the birds for a week or two. 2  After a few days, the hawk will move on to different hunting grounds but the smaller birds will quickly return when you resume feeding. 1 While this will not prevent small birds from panicking at a hawk’s approach, it will help give them a moment or two to flee while slowing down the hawk. 2  Protect Windows: Use decals and other methods to prevent window collisions by panicked birds.
These hawks prey mostly on songbirds and are the hawks one will most likely see coming to their bird feeders. As far as placing the feeders under the trees, it certainly can't hurt and birds do feel safer with the cover of trees nearby. Different hawks use different hunting tactics-depending on the their habitat and prey that is available. Buteos like the red-tailed hawk will soar on thermals to search for small mammals or they will sit in a tree and watch for movement on the ground. These hawks are often seen perched in trees along roadsides.
These hawks swallow smaller prey whole. Birds are beheaded, then eaten. Larger prey are killed with talons, and then pulled into pieces with the hawk's sharp, hooked beak. Red-tailed Hawks will steal from other raptors, such as eagles, owls, or other hawks. A Red-tailed Hawk can spot a mouse from a height of 100 feet. These hawks also hunt from perches, usually alongside a field. Most of their prey are small mammals, including: mice, voles, shrews, moles, squirrels, chipmunks, rats, rabbits, opossums, muskrats, cats, skunks, and bats.

Hawks pluck birds, leaving piles of feathers on the ground. Beak marks can sometimes be seen on the shafts of these plucked feathers. Owls also pluck their prey, but at times they will swallow small animals whole. Many raptors (especially red-tailed hawks and other buteos) feed on carrion. Hawks and owls are birds of prey and are frequently referred to as raptors— a term that includes the falcons, eagles, vultures, kites, ospreys, northern harriers, and crested caracaras.
Similarly, do not release cats in an attempt to scare a hawk away – cats will not usually attack birds as large as hawks, and the cats themselves may become victims to larger birds of prey. Furthermore, cats are just as likely to kill the backyard birds you hope to protect. 1 While this will not prevent small birds from panicking at a hawk’s approach, it will help give them a moment or two to flee while slowing down the hawk. 2  Protect Windows: Use decals and other methods to prevent window collisions by panicked birds.
1 When a hawk attacks, small birds will mistakenly fly into windows and a stunned bird is easy prey. 2  Remove Feeders: If hawks are still a menace to your backyard birds, remove all birdfeeders and cease feeding the birds for a week or two. 1 While this will not prevent small birds from panicking at a hawk’s approach, it will help give them a moment or two to flee while slowing down the hawk. 2  Protect Windows: Use decals and other methods to prevent window collisions by panicked birds.
1 This will allow small birds to access the food in relative security since larger birds, including hawks, will not be able to reach them. 2  While this will not prevent small birds from panicking at a hawk’s approach, it will help give them a moment or two to flee while slowing down the hawk. 1 While this will not prevent small birds from panicking at a hawk’s approach, it will help give them a moment or two to flee while slowing down the hawk. 2  Protect Windows: Use decals and other methods to prevent window collisions by panicked birds.
Red-tailed Hawks are large, stocky birds. They are brown with a white breast and a rust-colored tail. If you can get close enough, the tail is the best way to identify them. Young Red-tailed Hawks are more dull in color, have more streaks, and are missing the red in their tails. A Red-tailed Hawk can spot a mouse from a height of 100 feet. These hawks also hunt from perches, usually alongside a field.
