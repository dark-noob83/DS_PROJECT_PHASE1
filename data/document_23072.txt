The glaciers of the Andes Mountains have retreated at an unprecedented rate in the past three decades, with more ice lost than at any other time in the last 400 years.
The Andes. The Andes Mountains are the longest mountain chain in the world. They stretch along the entire west coast of South America from Cape Horn to Panama, a distance of 4,500 miles. Only the Himalaya Mountains and their adjacent ranges such as the Hindu Kush are higher than the Andes range.
But these glaciers are particularly sensitive to climate change, because there is little seasonality in temperatures in the tropics, Rabatel said. Glaciers of the tropical Andes react strongly and more rapidly than other glaciers on Earth to any changes in climate conditions, he said. [ Ice World: Gallery of Awe-Inspiring Glaciers ]. To piece together the story of the glaciers over the past centuries, Rabatel and his colleagues drew on disparate strands of data.
