The purpose of meiosis is to divide the number of chromosomes in gamete cells (spermatazoa and oocytes) to the haploid number (23 chromosomes). Meiosis ensures the prope … r number of chromosomes to form a zygote, which is 46 chromosomes (diploid number), during fertilization.     Essentially, somatic cells (all other cells except gamete cells) require 46 chromosomes. 23 of these come from the mother and the other 23 from the father. During fertilization, the sperm and oocyte containing the haploid number come together to produce the diploid number.
The constancy of the chromosome number from one cell generation to the next is maintained through ________.
Report Abuse. meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes in the gametes to haploid (half of the diploid number in autosomal cells) and when a gamete from mommy and daddy come together they each have only half the number the offspring will eventually have.
Even though meiosis divides them mitosis maintains the chromosome number from cell to cell because its job is to keep the health and grow the cells which alters the chromosome … s but keeps the number.
However, parental gametes the sperm and egg cells are unique from all other cells in that they reproduce through a process called meiosis. The purpose of meiosis is to shuffle genetic information and cut the cellular chromosome number in half, from 46 chromosomes to 23 chromosomes.
In meiosis I there is a reduction of the chromosome number from diploid (two separate copies of each chromosome) to haploid (one copy of each chromosome) during the formation of gametes.
