A monomer is the basic unit of a polymer. A polymer is the basic unit of a monomer. Whether something is a monomer or a polymer is determined by the sequence of subunits in the molecule. Monomers and polymers are basically the same. The quantity of the substance present determines whether it is a monomer or
Polymer means many monomers. Sometimes polymers are also known as macromolecules or large-sized molecules. Usually, polymers are organic (but not necessarily). A monomer is a molecule that is able to bond in long chains. Here is a monomer: Here is a polymer: A polymer can be made up of thousands of monomer. This linking up of monomers is called polymerization. It is the long chains that give polymers their unique properties.
In this case, we showed a polymer that is made up of one monomer, but it's also possible to have polymers that are made up of different monomers. One polymer that is made of different monomer units is nylon, which is a combination of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid.
In hydrolysis, two monomers are joined together to form a polymer, and a water molecule is given off. In dehydration synthesis, a polymer separates into monomers, a water molecule splits, and part of the water molecule goes with each monomer.
Plastics. What I mean when I say polymer is a long chain molecule that is made up of many smaller units or that is made from many smaller units. Each unit is called a monomer or single, while polymers are many. Each unit can be combined to make a many unit molecule, or polymer. In the case of the plastic milk jug that we talked about, it's made up of polyethylene.
A monomer is a repeating structure, or unit, within a type of large molecule known as a polymer. The word comes from the Greek mono meaning one and meros meaning part; it is one of many similar parts of a long chain that makes up the molecule.
