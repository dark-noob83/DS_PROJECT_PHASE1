Middle-class people in the USA have a median of $20,000 saved for retirement, far short of the $250,000 they think they'll need during that time of their lives, a new survey shows. On average, those who have access to a 401(k) plan saved 10 times more than those who don't have a plan. • 50% of middle-class adults in their 50s say they will work until they are at least 80 years old because they will not have enough saved for retirement.
On average, each American has saved a total of only about $58,000 for their retirements. For affluent investors, or those with at least $250,000 in investible assets, the average retirement savings is $342,592, which means they are better prepared to face retirement than the rest of U.S. workers. For those with less than $250,000 in investible assets, the average retirement account amounts to only $29,358.
More than half of working Americans have no retirement plans; start saving as soon as possible. The average person with a retirement plan -- particularly a 401(k) -- has just a little more than $60,000 saved, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's May 2012 Retirement Confidence Survey. The average retirement age is 62 and the average length of retirement is 18 years.

Among people 55 to 64, average household retirement savings total only $12,000. For those near retirement who have savings, the average balance is $100,000 – still not much money to finance the next 20 to 30 years. The rule of thumb for retirement accounts is that you should withdraw no more than 4 percent a year. If you have $100,000 in savings, that means $4,000 a year, or about $333 per month.

Savings by Age. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, workers younger than 35 have an average of $6,000 saved. Those 35 to 44 years old have $22,500 saved on average, and those aged 45 to 54 have just less than $44,000 stowed away. The average 55 to 64-year-olds only have about $65,000 in savings and those 65 and older have saved $56,000. The average retirement age is 62 and the average length of retirement is 18 years.

According to a recent survey, 51% of workers over the age of 55 have less than $50,000 saved for retirement. And 39% in that same age group have less than $25,000 in retirement savings. Those are frightening numbers if you consider that those people are very close to the typical age of retirement. 
Small increases to those accounts every month can mean tens of thousands of additional dollars in savings. For example, if an investor has $12,000 in retirement savings, contributes $100 per month, and earns an average annual return 6.5%, then they'll have a portfolio worth $88,874 in 20 years. Increase that $100 monthly investment to $200, and the portfolio balance could grow to $135,464 -- that's an additional $46,590. 
Baby Boomer Averages. The age group between 45 to 62 years old has set aside $38,000 on average, as of 2012, according to The Survivors Club website. That savings rate is for people who don't have a company-sponsored retirement plan. Those with a company plan have saved $88,000 on average. If you feel you're not keeping up with what the average person is doing for retirement or the target savings rates for your age group, you have some catching up to do. Certain retirement accounts allow you to accelerate your savings rate after age 50.
