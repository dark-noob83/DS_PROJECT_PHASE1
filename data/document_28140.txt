Back to what I was saying about pulp, it's healthier, but it's not really better. Orange juice is something that should be refreshing during the morning and little objects swimming in your drink and are ready to rub against your mouth and tickle your throat are only going to crash your party.
If you’re keeping the pulp and most of the “tissue” in the orange (for example) you’re fine. But I would avoid juicing 10 oranges and just drinking the juice every morning. That’s a lot of sugar, without some of the fiber and roughage to slow down the absorption of it.
Higher pulp orange juice is more nutritious than no-pulp varieties because of the flavonoids contained in the pulp. Eating foods that contain flavonoids “neutralizes the oxidative and inflammatory stress generated by the unhealthy food and helps prevent blood vessel damage” according to a University at Buffalo study.
Lucky for us, we have precisely that! So it IS better for you to keep the pulp in the OJ... but for some unknown reason. Whatever the hell pulp is can be turned into fiber and other things for food alteration, but it's not fiber when we get it, nor does it affect the nutrition label. Pulp contains a lot of flavonoids. In fact in your average orange, nearly all of the flavonoids are contained in the pulp. And flavonoids don't show up on any label, but our body does something with them, so is there any benefit to consuming them.
Still, I think the conclusion to be reached is that the difference between OJ with and without pulp is very small and, if anything, indirect. You can achieve it by simply having a good, all-around diet. The difference between an actual orange and juice is nothing more than calories.
