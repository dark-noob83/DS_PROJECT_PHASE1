A salary cap existed in the early days of the National Hockey League (NHL).

The CBA also contains a salary floor which is formally titled the Lower Limit of the Payroll Range, the minimum that each team must pay in player salaries.

Education and Experience. It is common for companies to pay employees according to a scale. For example, a classified listing may state a job pays between $10 and $15 per hour. A qualified candidate who has a greater amount of education and/or experience than one who meets the basic job requirements is likely to earn more money. 
In terms of minimum salary for each team, the salary floor is 89% of the cap. That became effective in 2013, as this requirement was by-passed in 2011 and 2012. Hence, there was in essence no salary floor in 2011 or 2012. For 2011, each team may designate up to 3 of their highest paid players (who must have at least 5 accrued seasons and make at least $1 M more than the league minimum salary for that year), toward whom the team will will receive $1 M cap credit. Repayment of this credit will be applied toward the 2014-2017 league years.
