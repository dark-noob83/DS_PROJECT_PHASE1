State by state low temperature records. Each state's low temperature record. As you would expect, the coldest temperature ever officially recorded in the USA was in Alaska. It was -79.8°F-rounded off to -80°F-observed at Prospect Creek Camp in the Endicott Mountains of northern Alaska on Jan. 23, 1971. The lowest ever recorded in the contiguous 48 States, was -69.7°F (rounded off to -70°F) at Rogers Pass, in Lewis and Clark County, Mont., on Jan. 20, 1954. Rogers Pass is on State Highway 200 about 40 miles northwest of Helena.
A subsequent measurement of −88.3 °C (−126.9 °F; 184.8 K), on August 24, 1960, held the record until a temperature of −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F; 184.0 K) was measured at the Soviet Vostok Station, on the Antarctic Plateau, on July 21, 1983. This remains the record for a directly recorded temperature. A 2009 study estimated that under exceptional climate conditions similar to those recorded at Vostok in 1983, temperatures higher on the plateau around Dome Argus could potentially drop as low as −95 °C (−139 °F; 178 K).
LTL » World record in low temperatures. Researchers of the YKI-group of the Low Temperature Laboratory have achieved the lowest temperature ever produced.(*). The record-low temperature was reached in a piece of rhodium metal, which was cooled to 100 pK, or 0.000 000 000 1 degrees above the absolute zero. The absolute zero is the limit of all temperatures, —273.15...
The coldest temperature ever recorded east of the Mississippi River was -60°F in Tower, Minn., on Feb. 2, 1996. Hawaii is the only state that's never recorded a below-zero temperature. Many are surprised at Hawaii's 12°F reading. The lowest ever recorded in the contiguous 48 States, was -69.7°F (rounded off to -70°F) at Rogers Pass, in Lewis and Clark County, Mont., on Jan. 20, 1954. Rogers Pass is on State Highway 200 about 40 miles northwest of Helena.
This is a list of weather records, a list of the most extreme occurrences of weather phenomena for various categories. Many weather records are measured under specific conditions—such as surface temperature and wind speed—to keep consistency among measurements around the Earth. Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth is still at Death Valley, but is instead 53.9 °C (129 °F) recorded five times: 20 July 1960, 18 July 1998, 20 July 2005, 7 July 2007, and 30 June 2013.
The lowest natural temperature ever directly recorded at ground level on Earth is −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F; 184.0 K), which was at the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica, on July 21, 1983. This remains the record for a directly recorded temperature. A 2009 study estimated that under exceptional climate conditions similar to those recorded at Vostok in 1983, temperatures higher on the plateau around Dome Argus could potentially drop as low as −95 °C (−139 °F; 178 K).
by Liz Osborn CurrentResults.com. The coldest temperature ever recorded on earth is -89.2 degrees Celsius (-128.5 degrees Fahrenheit) at Vostok, Antarctica on July 21, 1983. That all-time low broke the previous world-record minimum of -88.3 °C (-126.9 °F), set on August 24, 1960, also at Vostok. During the first five years of operation, the coldest temperature recorded there was -82.5 °C (-116.5 °F) in July 2005, not low enough yet to set a new record.
See Lowest temperature recorded on Earth for details. † It is reported by local news outlet that temperatures in Mt. Pulag in the Philippines which is 2,922 meters above sea level plunges as low as 2 °C (35.6 °F). Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth is still at Death Valley, but is instead 53.9 °C (129 °F) recorded five times: 20 July 1960, 18 July 1998, 20 July 2005, 7 July 2007, and 30 June 2013.
As for the USA's coldest mark on record, it's -80 degrees, set in Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971, according to Christopher Burt, weather historian for the Weather Underground. Excluding Alaska, the lowest temperature was the -70-degree temperature recorded in Rogers Pass, Mont., in January 1954. A reading of 135.8 degrees below zero was measured in Antarctica, using remote sensing from satellites. East Antarctica, seen here in 2008, is the coldest spot on Earth: A new look at NASA satellite data revealed that the planet set a new record for coldest temperature.
