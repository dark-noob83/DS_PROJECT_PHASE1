How long would it be if you added 2 more centimeters? 11. How many centimeters are in two decimeters? 12. If you added one decimeter to 24 centimeters, how many centimeters would you have? 13. A piece of paper is a meter long. 
1 m = 100 cm, so a meter stick has 100 cm. Thus. . . There are 100 centimeters on a meter stick. mi … lli means one one-thousandth. So, a milli-meter is one one-thousandth of a meter.
Instructions. Know what you are looking at. A meter stick is a meter long, and it will be marked off in decimeters (there are 10 of these per meter), centimeters (10 of these per decimeter and 100 per meter) and millimeters (there are 10 of these per centimeter and 1,000 of these per meter). 
A meterstick is a measuring device (like a ruler or yardstick) and is usually exactly one meter in length*. In the metric SI system of measurement 1 meter = 100 centimeters. A centimeter is exactly 1/100 of a meter. A meterstick is a stick that is 100 centimeters long, roughly 39 inches. Generally used to measure distance.   or the easy way is a meter stick is about 1 yardyour welcome! … !!
Both devices are marked in centimeters and millimeters. Metric rulers are generally 15 cm (6 inches) and 30 cm (12 inches) long, while meter sticks are 1 meter (about 1 yard) long. Students should understand that accurate and precise measurements of length and distance are very important for scientific investigations.
Decimals can be used to show tenths and hundredths when using metric measure. A meter stick is often used to measure objects around us. There are 10 decimeters in one meter stick. Each decimeter would be written as 0.1 (one tenth) of a whole meter. Two decimeters would be 0.2 (two tenths). 0.04 0.4 0.14 4.0. There are five decimeters (five tenths of a meter) in a half meter. 0.5 0.05 0.15 5.0. One decimeter (one tenth of a meter) is equal to ten centimeters.
2. Know how to convert meters to centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. 1  To convert a measurement taken in meters to an equal measurement in centimeters, you should multiply the original measurement by 100. 2  Example: 5.1 m * 100 = 510 cm. Convert millimeters to centimeters. There are 10 millimeters in 1 centimeter. 1  To convert a measurement taken in millimeters to a measurement in centimeters, you need to divide the measurement by 10. 2  Example: 583 mm / 10 = 58.33 cm.
A meter stick is one meter long centi means one one-hundredth. So, a centi-meter is one one-hundredth of a meter. Thus. . . There are 100 centimeters on a meter stick. mi … lli means one one-thousandth. So, a milli-meter is one one-thousandth of a meter. Thus. . . There are 1000 millimeters on a meter stick
