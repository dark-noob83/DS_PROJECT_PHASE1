The most distal portion of the stomach is the antrum which comprises about ¼ of the stomach and largely contains G cells and D cells. Distal to the antrum is the pyloric sphincter which connects to the beginning of the duodenum of the small intestine.
Antrum: A general term for a nearly closed cavity or chamber. For example, the antrum of the stomach (gastric antrum) is a portion before the outlet, which is lined by mucosa and does not produce acid. The paranasal sinuses can be referred to as the frontal antrum, ethmoid antrum, and maxillary antrum.
pyloric antrum, antrum pyloricum. the lumen of the pyloric part of the stomach; the pump of the stomach, regulating the propulsion of food through the pylorus into the duodenum.
pyloric antrum, antrum pylo´ricum the dilated portion of the pyloric part of the stomach, between the body of the stomach and the pyloric canal. Pyloric antrum (antrum pyloricum).
mastoid antrum an air space in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone communicating with the middle ear and the mastoid cells. antrum maxilla´re (maxillary antrum) maxillary sinus. pyloric antrum (antrum pylo´ricum) the proximal, expanded portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. tympanic antrum (antrum tympa´nicum) mastoid antrum.
1 Body (corpus): The main part of the stomach, between the upper and lower parts. 2  Antrum: The lower portion (near the intestine), where the food is mixed with gastric juice. 3  Pylorus: The last part of the stomach, which acts as a valve to control emptying of the stomach contents into the small intestine.
Antrum is the internal lining of the stomach. When the appearance  of the lining becomes red or inflamed, a condition called erythema  is occurring which will lead to gastri … tis or peptic ulcer. Erythema  is usually caused by high exposure to acid or overdose of medicine  intake such as Ibuprofen.
