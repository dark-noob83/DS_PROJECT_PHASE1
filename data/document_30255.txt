Of course, that doesn't mean Costco employees are being paid like they work at a company like Facebook or Microsoft. The average hourly wage is around $21. That's not a lot considering that Facebook interns can make double what the average hourly worker at Costco makes in a month, assuming a 40 hour work week. 
Annual worker turnover rate. Costco 24%. Wal-Mart 50%. Costco pays starting employees at least $10 an hour, and with regular raises a full-time hourly worker can make $40,000 annually within 3.5 years. Cashiers are paid $10.50 to $17.50 an hour. Costco also pays 92% of its employees' health-insurance premiums, much higher than the 80% average at large U.S. companies. 
Of course, The Container Store isn't the only major retail chain that professes a commitment to paying its workers a livable wage. At Costco, hourly workers make an average of more than $20 an hour — well above the national average of $11.39 for a retail sales worker — according to a 2013 Businessweek story. For employees who put in 40 hours per week, that works out to about $43,000 a year. In addition, Businessweek reports that 88% of Costco's 185,000 employees have company-sponsored healthcare. The Container Store uses its high salaries to lure and retain elite talent.

There's more going on here. 1. The company pays a living wage. Costco's CEO and president, Craig Jelinek, has publicly endorsed raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, and he takes that to heart. The company's starting pay is $11.50 per hour, and the average employee wage is $21 per hour, not including overtime. Most other big box retailers start their employees at minimum wag
A Sam's Club employee starts at $10 and makes $12.50 after four and a half years. A new Costco employee, at $11 an hour, doesn't start out much better, but after four and a half years she makes $19.50 an hour.

An average Costco worker made about $45,000 in 2011, according to Fortune. That’s compared to an average of about $17,486 per year for a worker at comparable Walmart-owned Sam’s Club. And apparently the extra pay pays off. Costco makes more than $10,000 in profits per employee, while Walmart takes home about $7,400 per worker, according to the Daily Beast (Walmart and Costco aren’t exactly the same type of business, however).
