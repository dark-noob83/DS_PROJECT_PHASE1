Microhabitat For Foraging. Foraging is restricted to intertidal sand or mud flats, oyster or mussel reefs and less commonly along rocky shorelines. Oystercatchers often feed along the edge of receding tide on sand or mud flats but in shellfish beds they forage while mussels or oysters are still submerged (see below). Nutrition and Energetics. In a study of breeding season time budgets (Nol 1985), birds spent 10%, 19%, 10.5%, and 23% of their time searching for food in the pre-laying, laying, incubation, and chick-rearing periods, respectively.

In Korea, for instance, oyster exports in 1982 contributed to about 54% to the total export of canned marine products to Canada, Australia, Holland and Sweden. This is also attributed to the successful culturing of oysters in the Southern sea area of the Korean Peninsula. The Philippines was a significant exporter of oyster to Singapore until the early 1980's. About 180,000 kg of oyster meat valued at Peso 215 million were exported to Singapore in 1980. Raft-tray. To grow single, well-shaped oysters for a particular market such as the half-shell trade, the tray method is used. A tray may be made of wire or plastic mesh with a wooden frame, or entirely made of bamboo.

The word oyster is used as a common name for a number of different families of saltwater clams, bivalve molluscs that live in marine or brackish habitats. In some species the valves are highly calcified, and many are somewhat irregular in shape. Many, but not all, oysters are in the superfamily Ostreoidea. Some kinds of oysters are commonly consumed, cooked or raw, by humans as a delicacy. Some kinds of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle. Windowpane oysters are harvested for their translucent shells, which are used to make various kinds of decorative objects. First attested in English during the 14th century, the word oyster comes from Old French oistre, in turn from Latin ostrea, the feminine form of ostreum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ὄστρεον (ostreon), oyster. Compare ὀστέον (osteon), bone.
Pearl oysters are not closely related to true oysters, being members of a distinct family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured pearls and natural pearls can be extracted from pearl oysters, though other molluscs, such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value. First attested in English during the 14th century, the word oyster comes from Old French oistre, in turn from Latin ostrea, the feminine form of ostreum, which is the latinisation of the Greek ὄστρεον (ostreon), oyster.

Oyster culture is one way of producing food from the sea by farming suitable waters and estuaries where hydrographic conditions favour oyster growth. It lends itself as a mean of providing artisanal occupation to coastal communities either as a principal mean of livelihood or to augment overall income. Raft-tray. To grow single, well-shaped oysters for a particular market such as the half-shell trade, the tray method is used. A tray may be made of wire or plastic mesh with a wooden frame, or entirely made of bamboo.
The oystercatchers are a group of waders forming the family Haematopodidae, which has a single genus, Haematopus.
