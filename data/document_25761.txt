Plant marigolds around the perimeter of the pumpkin patch. This is an attractive way to keep deer away from your pumpkins, as deer do not like the scent of marigolds. This method can be used in conjunction with other methods.

If things are frozen it takes them an especially long time to eat them, but each time you come back to the pumpkin, it will have a few more teeth marks in it. Also you must break it open to show the deer that the inside is food. Source(s): exp.
If you have a pumpkin patch and a deer problem, you will need to protect your pumpkins from the deer. Otherwise, the clever animals will wait until the pumpkins are ripe and eat them right off their vines.
Fuzzy, prickly plants: This group of deer resistant vegetables is less appealing to deer. It includes cucumbers, squash, and pumpkin. Deer don't like melon plants, but deer and lots of other animals like the melons. Root vegetables: Because digging is required to get to the tubers, root vegetables are somewhat deer resistant and are often passed over by deer as long as other palatable things are available.
