Average Starting Salaries. According to salary surveys conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), mechanical engineering graduates with a master's degree earned an average starting salary of $66,158 in 2009 and $69,954 in 2010. This average starting salary rose to $74,300 in 2011. As of 2012, NACE reported that mechanical engineers with a master's degree started at an average of $75,700 -- significantly more than the average starting salary of $61,300 reported by mechanical engineers with a bachelor's degree. Those who entered the manufacturing sector reported the lowest average starting salary, $71,900 per year. By comparison, those working for professional and scientific services averaged $73,900 to start, and those employed in management started at $75,000.
The average starting salary for a member of the class of 2013 is $44,928, up 5.3% from the previous year, driven by big gains in fields such as health sciences and business. But these figures are relevant only for those grads lucky enough to find a job during college-recruiting season or soon after.
