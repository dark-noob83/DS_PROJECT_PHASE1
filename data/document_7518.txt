The ostrich shares the order Struthioniformes with the kiwis, emus, rheas and cassowaries. However, phylogenetic studies have shown that it is the basal extant member of Palaeognathae and is thus equally closely related to flighted tinamous. The ostrich is the largest living species of bird and lays the largest eggs of any living bird (extinct elephant birds of Madagascar and the giant moa of New Zealand laid larger eggs). The ostrich's diet consists mainly of plant matter, though it also eats invertebrates. It lives in nomadic groups of 5 to 50 birds.
The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the second-largest living bird in the world by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia, but the Tasmanian emu and King Island emu subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788.
The ostrich or common ostrich (Struthio camelus) is either one or two species of large flightless birds native to Africa, the only living member(s) of the genus Struthio, which is in the ratite family. Starting in 2014, the Somali ostrich is now considered a full species separate from the common ostrich. The ostrich is the largest living species of bird and lays the largest eggs of any living bird (extinct elephant birds of Madagascar and the giant moa of New Zealand laid larger eggs). The ostrich's diet consists mainly of plant matter, though it also eats invertebrates. It lives in nomadic groups of 5 to 50 birds.
They did not settle it. In 1688, English pirate William Dampier also came a â€¦ cross Australia's western coast, but found the land to be inhospitable, and the Aborigines a savage people. He did not recommend Australia for settlement. If you are meaning 5 animals that are not found in Australia in the wild then LionTigerElephantGiraffePolar Bear. Edit.

Ostriches are definitely not native to Australia. However, ostrich farming resulted in the release of some of these birds in South Australia in the late 1800s, and consequently there are known to be some feral populations in two widely divergent areas-around Port Augusta and Murray Bridge.
No. The ostrich is native to Africa, not Australia. Two karge, flightless birds found in Australia are the emu and the cassowary. Both of these are ratites, like the ostrich, but very different species. Emus and cassowaries are smaller than the ostrich, and do not really look like the ostrich at all.

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world with a male ostrich often growing more than 2 metres tall. The ostrich is also the world's fastest bird on the ground being able to run at speeds of up to 50 mph for short periods of time. The ostrich mainly eats grubs and insects, often found in the ground. The ostrich is well known for putting it's head into the ground to get the bugs in the soil. The ostrich also has a kick so powerful that it can be fatal to most mammals.
