The average cost for a kitchen renovation depends on many factors -- including the size of the kitchen, the quality of the materials and the complexity of the job. This rule holds that the entire remodel should cost no less than 5% of the current value of the home -- and no more than 15%. This is because spending less than 5% may result in a lesser home value, while a homeowner is unlikely to recoup an investment of more than 15% in a resale.
