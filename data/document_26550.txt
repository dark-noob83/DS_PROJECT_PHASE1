Probiotics are bacteria that help keep the natural balance of organisms (microflora) in the intestines. The normal human digestive tract contains about 400 types of probiotic bacteria that reduce the growth of harmful bacteria and promote a healthy digestive system.
The body does not need the addition of food and supplements that contain probiotics to be healthy. However, food and supplements that contain probiotics assist the job of the good bacteria already present in your gut. Probiotics may help keep you healthy by:
Probiotics and Vitamin K. To aid in digesting and assimilating vitamin K and to populate your intestines with the good guys that make vitamin K, probiotics are key. The best source of probiotics are fermented foods and drinks. These superfoods build your healthy inner ecosystem, boosting your immunity.
Probiotics are found in foods such as yogurt, while prebiotics are found in whole grains, bananas, onions, garlic, honey and artichokes. In addition, probiotics and prebiotics are added to some foods and available as dietary supplements.
Probiotic vitamins. Probiotic vitamins are loaded with numerous types of good bacteria that aid in your digestion process, the prevention of illness, and the suppression of allergies. Picking the right probiotics for your needs can increase your health and energy levels for a healthier, happier you.
You don't necessarily need probiotics — a type of good bacteria — to be healthy. However, these microorganisms may help with digestion and offer protection from harmful bacteria, just as the existing good bacteria in your body already do. Prebiotics are nondigestible carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics.
Yeast is also a probiotic substance. Probiotics are also available as dietary supplements. It has been suggested that probiotics be used to treat problems in the stomach and intestines. But only certain types of bacteria or yeast (called strains) have been shown to work in the digestive tract.
