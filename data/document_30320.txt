Somehow, intensive aquaculture seems to have avoided the close scrutiny of the economics of diminishing returns. The basic costs for low management catfish production, feed ($630; $0.14/lb) and fingerlings ($225; $0.15/fish), would be $855/acre. Low density, autumn stocking in combination with temperature-based feeding substantially increased channel catfish fingerling weight by the subesequent spring. The advanced spring fingerling size (0.19-lb) allowed production of a 1.45-lb food-fish (1343 fish/acre) in 180 days.
As the number of pounds of catfish produced per acre increases, the cost to produce a pound of fish increases. A catfish yield of 4500 lb/acre requires significant external inputs: energy (e.g. aeration), chemicals, antibiotics, feed, time, labor, etc. These additional inputs cost money and cut into potential profits. Low density, autumn stocking in combination with temperature-based feeding substantially increased channel catfish fingerling weight by the subesequent spring. The advanced spring fingerling size (0.19-lb) allowed production of a 1.45-lb food-fish (1343 fish/acre) in 180 days.
First-year production in well-managed Alabama crawfish ponds have averaged about 500 pounds per acre. Second-year yields have averaged around 750 pounds with a few farms producing 1,000 pounds per acre. An excellent average crawfish production would be 1,200 to 1,500 pounds per acre. A producer will rarely achieve 1,500 to 2,000 pounds per acre in a single pond. 
For example, during 2007-09, the average per acre farm value of U.S. fresh-market field tomato production was $12,238, meaning that a farm with just 82 acres of fresh tomatoes could have farm sales in excess of $1 million. 
Fish were stocked in 0.5- and 1.0-acre ponds. Fingerlings (0.1 lb each) were stocked at 2000 fish/acre. Feeding, at 1-3% of biomass, was adjusted in accordance with standard temperature-based recommendations. Surface water temperatures reported for a large, local reservoir (Lake Barkley) were used to adjust feeding. Low density, autumn stocking in combination with temperature-based feeding substantially increased channel catfish fingerling weight by the subesequent spring. The advanced spring fingerling size (0.19-lb) allowed production of a 1.45-lb food-fish (1343 fish/acre) in 180 days.
Ponds as small as 0.25 acre or as large as 20 acres are suitable. However, ponds in the 1- to 5-acre range are more practical. A stocking density of 1,500 fish/ac can provide yields as high as 2,000 to 2,300 lb/ac annually. However, production costs could be significantly lower with small-scale practices. Yields of 1,000 lb/ac annually would have a home-use value of $1,200 to $1,340 per acre. At production levels of 2,200 to 2,500 lb/ac annually, the retail value of home-use production is $2,600 to $3,000 per acre. Estimating that there are 1,500 ac of home-use catfish ponds in
1,000% more productive than conventional gardening & farming. The most robust, most scalable Aquaponics system in the world is the Portable Farmsâ„¢ Aquaponics System. Maxed out, you can produce 240,000 vegetables and 92,000 pounds of fish per acre, using up to 95% less water and no dirt. These are locally grown, organic, vine ripened vegetables and the freshest of the fresh Tilapia, Catfish or Salmon
Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are carp, salmon, tilapia and catfish. There is an increasing demand for fish and fish protein, which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries, China holding 62 percent of the world's fish farming practice. Fish farming offers fish marketers another source.
