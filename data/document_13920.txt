Normally, levels of ALT in the blood are low. Very high levels of ALT (more than 10 times normal) are usually due to acute hepatitis, sometimes due to a viral infection. In acute hepatitis, ALT levels usually stay high for about 1-2 months but can take as long as 3-6 months to return to normal.
The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is done to: 1  Identify liver disease, especially cirrhosis and hepatitis caused by alcohol, drugs, or viruses. 2  Help check for liver damage. 3  Find out whether jaundice was caused by a blood disorder or liver disease. 4  Keep track of the effects of medicines that can damage the liver.
The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is typically used to detect liver injury. It is often ordered in conjunction with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or as part of a liver panel to screen for and/or help diagnose liver disease.
A. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases. But it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with liver disease. They may mean liver problems or they may not.
A. ALT or Alanine Aminotransferase is an enzyme present in the liver to assist in metabolizing body protein. Normal ALT level range is 10 to 40. Elevated ALT levels can be cause for concern and may indicate liver damage.
ALT is often performed together with a test for AST or as part of a liver panel. For more about ALT results in relation to other liver tests, see the Liver Panel article.
Guide. An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test measures the amount of this enzyme in the blood. ALT is found mainly in the liver, but also in smaller amounts in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. ALT was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).
