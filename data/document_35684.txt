From 14,000 feet, your freefall lasts approximately 65 seconds, compared to the 20 second freefall from 8,000 feet offered by other skydiving centers. The parachute ride will last between 5-7 minutes, depending on the number of turns you do while in the air.
Other skydiving positions such as a head-down position, where the skydiver i … s in a vertical, upside down position, can reach speeds as fast as 200 miles per hour. Other factors such as weight, flexibility, and body position can also affect how fast a person falls on any given skydive.
The speed at which you freefall is called your terminal velocity and that varies depending on the type of skydive you are doing. When you come to do your first skydive, it will probably be a tandem skydive from 13000ft. You will experience a freefall where the parachute is packed into a container and harness system.
The velocity of a skydiver is largely governed by weight and  drag. Obviously both can vary quite a bit. The typical  skydiver flying in belly or prone position reaches th … e terminal  velocity of about 110mph to 130mph (typically 120mph) after about  1000ft of freefall. This equates to a rate of approximately 1000ft  for every 5.5 seconds.
The average freefall speed is 120-130 mph. In a student jump from over 2 miles up, this allows you to fall for about 45 seconds before you will reach deployment altitude. The skydiver's weight or body position can alter this speed. The freefall speed record is over 330 mph!
