Step 2: Choose a topic and explain that students are going to learn how to write a paragraph using the Traffic Light System.

Teaching your kid how to write complete sentences can be challenging, especially when a great deal of common speech consists of sentence fragments. In spite of this, there are techniques that have been shown to work.
Students need to circle all the sentences that are not complete. Then, on the bottom, students need to complete the sentences they circled. On sentence strips, write phrases that are sentences and incomplete sentences. On the board or on a pocket chart, have two columns with the headings Sentence and Not a Sentence.
Learning to write sentences is a gradual process for all kids because there are many steps and stages. Your child first needs to understand that a sentence is a series of words that form a statement, question, command or an exclamation.

Teaching the basic sentence form involves making sure that students understand what a sentence is and what parts must be included to make up a complete sentence. It is also important to explain the types of errors that can occur when writing sentences. Use these steps to teach students to write a basic sentence.
We learn how to write sentences early on, and while this is a basic skill, it is one that we must learn to expand on as writing sentences becomes increasingly complex. Learning how to write impactful sentences is an important skill that takes practice.
