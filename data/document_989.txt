RE: How much does PSA grading cost for baseball cards? I have a bundle of &#39;71 Topps and am thinking about getting them graded. Anyone know how much it would cost for a car? a dozen? a hundred? Im not sure how much it coast to get it done, but I do know that if you get a good grading on your card it can triple the value...sometimes more. My guess is that it's probably about 5 bucks a card cause otherwise everyone would send all there star player cards off to get graded.
Even when we buy a card that is professionally graded-we still grade the card ourselves. For example, if PSA graded a card ExMt and we feel that it should be Nr/Mt-we will pay the NrMt price. If we agree, with the grade-we may pay a few bucks more (seldom more the cost of the grading!). Quite often we will remove the under graded cards from the PSA case to allow us to sell them for more money.

Some people-who are looking to sell their collections-have been told that baseball cards are worth more when they are graded. The professional card grading companies such as PSA, SCG & Beckett love to make this claim, as it is a justification for charging $5 to $15 to grade a common card! The real cost to have a card graded is usually $14 to $17 per card when you consider the overpriced shipping and insurance charges. For example, if PSA graded a card ExMt and we feel that it should be Nr/Mt-we will pay the NrMt price. If we agree, with the grade-we may pay a few bucks more (seldom more the cost of the grading!). Quite often we will remove the under graded cards from the PSA case to allow us to sell them for more money.
