Tree Sizes. The size of the tree in question plays a large role in how much you’ll pay to have it removed. For example: 1  Small Trees up to 30 Feet in Height – $125 to $450. 2  Medium Trees between 30 and 60 Feet in Height – $175 to $950. 3  Large Trees between 60 and 80 Feet in Height – $400 to $1,100.
Calculate the cost based on the size of your tree. Although prices vary depending on the company and the area in which you live, you can assume that you'll pay $10 per foot to have a large tree cut down. The smaller the tree, the less money per foot it will cost.
One of the ways that you can determine how much it would cost to remove your tree is to find out how large your tree is. The cost of a smaller tree is going to be around 125 dollars while a taller tree can run between 900-1400 dollars to be cut down. Stability of your tree is also an important factor in pricing your tree, and taller trees can tend to be less stable which partially attributes to their higher costs.
To remove a tree that is 45 feet tall, consumers can expect to pay around $450. Large trees are between 50 and 90 feet in height and two to four feet thick. These trees will cost around $10 per foot. To remove a 90-foot tree, consumers will pay at least $900.
Although it can vary depending on the company, typically a large tree is 60 to 80 feet tall. A small tree is usually 30 feet tall or shorter, and a medium tree is commonly 30 to 60 feet in height. Anything over 80 feet tall is considered to be very large and, therefore, much more costly to remove.
Estimate the height of the tree you need removed. The cost of cutting the tree down will depend on the size of the tree, and what you consider to be large might be in a different category as far as the tree-cutting service is concerned.
Step 2. Calculate the cost based on the size of your tree. Although prices vary depending on the company and the area in which you live, you can assume that you'll pay $10 per foot to have a large tree cut down. The smaller the tree, the less money per foot it will cost.
