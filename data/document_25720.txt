Sections. Definition. A biochemical reaction is the transformation of one molecule to a different molecule inside a cell. Biochemical reactions are mediated by enzymes, which are biological catalysts that can alter the rate and specificity of chemical reactions inside cells. News and Comment. 1  News.
1 To define Gibbs free energy, determine the Gibbs free energy change associated with a biochemical reaction, and identify spontaneous and non-spontaneous reactions. 2  To understand the role that enzymes play in biochemical reactions. 3  To understand how ATP provides the energy to power cellular work.
All the chemical processes/reactions which take place within the living body at cellular level are termed as biochemical reactions.These reactions usually occur with the help of enzymes. For Example: Photosynthesis(formation of glucose) and respiration(breakdown of glucose).
