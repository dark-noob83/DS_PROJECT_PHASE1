The last North Texas earthquake to get a lot of attention was recorded on July 28, 2012 when a magnitude 2.2 quake was felt in Johnson County. The epicenter of that earthquake was between Cleburne and Burleson. Published at 11:29 PM CDT on Sep 29, 2012.
In Japan, for example, in the early 1990s, many seismologists suggested that the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 (a magnitude-8.2 quake that killed more than 140,000 people in Tokyo and Yokohama) would repeat itself sometime in the mid-1990s to the early-2000s based on a 70- to 80-year cycle.
It was the third earthquake to be felt in southwestern Indiana in the last two years. The first was a magnitude 3.9 on December 7, 2000, centered near Evansville, and the second was a magnitude 5.0 on June 18, 2002, also centered near Evansville.
Two days prior to the massive temblor, a magnitude-7.2 earthquake with three aftershocks greater than magnitude 6.0 hit offshore eastern Honshu. These quakes caused little damage even though the main rupture was only 8 kilometers deep.
The horrific earthquake that struck Nepal Saturday did not come as a surprise to experts. They knew it was coming. In fact, just last week a group of earthquake specialists gathered in Kathmandu to try to figure out how the country could prepare for the major earthquake they feared was imminent.
The earthquake giving rise to the tsunami occurred at 6,000 feet below sea level 80 miles from northern Japan and 240 miles from Tokyo. Seismic waves (sound traveling through â€¦ the solid crust of the earth below the ocean floor) move at around 14,000 KM/hr or about 8,300 miles/hr.
The Wasatch Range, with its outstanding ski areas, runs North-South through Utah, and like all mountain ranges, was produced by a series of earthquakes. The 386 km (240-mile) long Wasatch Fault is made up of several segments, each capable of producing up to a M7.5 earthquake.
An earthquake is the shaking of the ground cause by seismic waves. Almost all earthquakes occur when pent up stress in rocks along large, active faults (like the SAF) is suddenly released as the rock breaks.
