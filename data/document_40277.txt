As if lice weren't bad enough, now parents have a new bug to fear -- super lice, and they may be coming to a school near you. New research published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, a publication of the Entomological Society of America, shows that lice are becoming increasingly difficult to remove.
Lice — and other insects — are increasingly becoming resistant to pyrethroids, the active ingredients in most OTC concoctions, according to Kyong Yoon, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University—Edwardsvillle. Yoon was part of the research team that initially discovered the new ultra-resistant strains.
That's thanks to a new strain of critter that is resistant to traditional treatments. In fact, this new strain — dubbed super lice — doesn't seem to respond to any of the over-the-counter lice treatments currently on the market.
