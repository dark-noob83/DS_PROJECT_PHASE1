A chemical reaction is a process that is usually characterized by a chemical change in which the starting materials (reactants) are different from the products. Chemical reactions tend to involve the motion of electrons, leading to the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. 
1 Acid-Base Reaction. 2  An acid-base reaction is type of double displacement reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. 3  The H + ion in the acid reacts with the OH-ion in the base to form water and an ionic salt: 4  HA + BOH → H 2 O + BA. 1 Direct Combination or Synthesis Reaction. 2  In a synthesis reaction two or more chemical species combine to form a more complex product. 3  A + B → AB. 4  The combination of iron and sulfur to form iron (II) sulfide is an example of a synthesis reaction :
A chemical equation is a textual representation of the substances that participate in a chemical reaction. Coefficients are used to indicate the relative ratios of reactants and products to satisfy conservation of mass, charge, and energy. Chemists classify chemical reactions into five major groups according to number of reactants, number of products, and/or the species participating in reaction: Two ionic compound in the compound 2 with oxygen.
1 An acid-base reaction is type of double displacement reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. 2  The H + ion in the acid reacts with the OH-ion in the base to form water and an ionic salt: 3  HA + BOH → H 2 O + BA. 4  The reaction between hydrobromic acid (HBr) and sodium hydroxide is an example of an acid-base reaction: 1 Direct Combination or Synthesis Reaction. 2  In a synthesis reaction two or more chemical species combine to form a more complex product. 3  A + B → AB. 4  The combination of iron and sulfur to form iron (II) sulfide is an example of a synthesis reaction :
In order to use chemical reactions or evaluate their effects, you need to be able to identify the type of reaction. Success Criteria • Identify and differentiate between four types of chemical reactions: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement and double replacement. For the reaction between aqueous calcium nitrate and aqueous sodium hydroxide producing the precipitate (solid) calcium hydroxide and aqueous sodium nitrate (a) write an equation for this reaction (b) balance the equation from Part a (c) classify the reaction 3.

A chemical reaction is a process in which the identity of at least one substance changes. A chemical equation represents the total chemical change that occurs in a chemical reaction using symbols and chemical formulas for the substances involved. Reactants are the substances that are changed and products are the substances that are produced in a chemical reaction.
A chemical reaction equation gives the reactants and products, and a balanced chemical reaction equation shows the mole relationships of reactants and products. Often, the amount of energy involved in the reaction is given. Dealing with the quantitative aspect of chemical reactions is called reaction stoichiometry. Sometimes, the amount of energy involved in a reaction may be so small that the change in energy is not readily noticeable. An equation can be used to describe a physical reaction, which involves a change of states. For example, melting, sublimation, evaporation, and condensation can be represented as follow.
Chemical reactions can be classified into different categories. Four common types are synthesis, decomposition, single replacement and double replacement. Specific reactions corresponding to these general types are associated with health issues, environmental problems, and manufacturing processes. For the reaction between aqueous calcium nitrate and aqueous sodium hydroxide producing the precipitate (solid) calcium hydroxide and aqueous sodium nitrate (a) write an equation for this reaction (b) balance the equation from Part a (c) classify the reaction 3.
