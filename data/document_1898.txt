Per Meal. Women should have between 2 and 3.5 carbohydrate servings per meal, while men can have between 3 and 4. A carbohydrate serving is considered 15 grams, meaning that the total number of carbohydrates a woman should have at one sitting is between 30 and 55 grams and for men is 50 to 65.
Carbohydrates. Your goal should be to limit your carb intake to between 45 and 65 percent of total calories per day.

In addition, you should aim to eat at least 130 grams of carbs every day, split evenly throughout the day.
