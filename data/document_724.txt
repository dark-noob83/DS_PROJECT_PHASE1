A few basic facts: 1  Osteoporosis is a bone disease in which the amount and quality of the bone is reduced, leading to fractures (broken bones). 2  Osteoporosis produces no pain or other symptoms unless a fracture has occurred. 3  Arthritis (arth = joint; itis = inflammation) is a disease of the joints and surrounding tissue.

Osteoarthritis is a joint disease that mostly affects cartilage. Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over each other. It also helps absorb shock of movement. In osteoarthritis, the top layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away.

Osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, which means porous bones, causes bones to become weak and brittle. In most cases, bones weaken when you have low levels of calcium, phosphorus and other minerals in your bones. A common result of osteoporosis is fractures-most of them in the spine, hip or wrist.
Hip, spine and wrist fractures are the most common fractures associated with osteoporosis. Osteoarthritis most often affects the hips, knees, fingers (i.e., base of the thumb, tips and middle joints of the fingers), feet or spine. It affects each joint differently, and symptoms are easy to overlook.

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects the knees when the cartilage that supports and cushions the knee joint wears away. The knee contains a small amount of fluid that lubricates the cartilage. It also helps cushion the joint. With osteoarthritis, this fluid does not work as well, so it can be hard to move your joints.
