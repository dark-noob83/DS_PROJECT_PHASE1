Vacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between biogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the lysis and recycling of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell. In general, the functions of the vacuole include: 1  Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell. 2  Containing waste products. 3  Containing water in plant cells.

Answer by Beemusic. Confidence votes 433. Vacuoles in animal cells store food, water, waste, and minerals like plant cells. The only difference is that plant cells have larger vacuoles than animal cells. Plant cells have one large vacuole, which plays an important role in the rigidity and turgor pressure of the cell. Animal cells do not need the same kind of function from th … eir vacuoles, so the size and number of vacuoles in different cells will differ (depending on the type of cell).
Most mature plant cells have one large vacuole that typically occupies more than 30% of the cell's volume, and that can occupy as much as 80% of the volume for certain cell types and conditions. In general, the functions of the vacuole include: 1  Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell. 2  Containing waste products. 3  Containing water in plant cells.
A vacuole is a membrane-bound sac that plays roles in intracellular digestion and the release of cellular waste products. In animal cells, vacuoles are generally small. Vacu … oles tend to be large in plant cells and play a role in turgor pressure. When a plant is well-watered, water collects in cell vacuoles producing rigidity in the plant. Without sufficient water, pressure in the vacuole is reduced and the plant wilts.
A vacuole is a cell organelle found in a number of different cell types. Vacuoles are fluid-filled, enclosed structures that are separated from the cytoplasm by a single membrane. They are found mostly in plant cells and fungi. However, some protist, animal cells, and bacteria also contain vacuoles. A plant cell vacuole is surrounded by a single membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles are formed when vesicles, released by the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, merge together. Newly developing plant cells typically contain a number of smaller vacuoles.
(Answer #1). A vacuole is a cell organelle; is it basically a membranous bag filled with fluids. Vacuoles store water and certain materials that are water-soluble. They are present in all plant and fungi cells. They are also found in some species of bacteria and in some animal cells. In plants and fungi, vacuoles store water and some pigments, and they also provide turgor pressure to support the cells from within.
Quick look: A vacuole is a membrane-enclosed fluid filled sac found in the cells of plants including fungi. Vacuoles can be large organelles occupying between 30% and 90% of a cell by volume. Vacuoles appear to have three main functions, they: 1  contribute to the rigidity of the plant using water to develop hydrostatic pressure. 2  store nutrient and non-nutrient chemicals.
Many plant cells have a large, single central vacuole that typically takes up most of the room in the cell (80 percent or more). Vacuoles in animal cells, however, tend to be much smaller, and are more commonly used to temporarily store materials or to transport substances.
