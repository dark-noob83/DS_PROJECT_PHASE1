The term reflux is very widely used in industries that utilize large-scale distillation columns and fractionators such as petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, and natural gas processing plants. The more reflux provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better is the column's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Conversely, for a given desired separation, the more reflux is provided, the fewer theoretical plates are required.
Distillation is a process of separating the component substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.
Best Answer: In both instances, the substance is boiling. However, in distillation you are interested in collecting (or removing) the lower boiling substances. With reflux, the condensor is set up to return the condensed distillate to the flask. Hence, it boils perpetually and in principle never loses any liquid. In practice, there is always a slow loss.
Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction.
Reflux is widely used in large-scale, industrial continuous distillation columns as well as in laboratory distillation apparatus setups. It is also used in laboratories to supply heat to reactions over a long period of time. As the mixture is heated and boils, vapor rises up the column. Some of the vapor cools and condenses on the glass platforms (known as plates or trays) inside the column and runs back down into the liquid below, thereby refluxing the upflowing distillate vapor.

Reflux in beverage distillation [edit]. By controlling the temperature of the condenser, often called a dephlegmator, a reflux still may be used to ensure that higher boiling point components are returned to the flask while lighter elements are passed out to a secondary condenser. The more reflux provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better is the column's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Conversely, for a given desired separation, the more reflux is provided, the fewer theoretical plates are required.
Reflux is a distillation technique involving the condensation of vapors and the return of this condensate to the system from which it originated. The more reflux provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better is the column's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Conversely, for a given desired separation, the more reflux is provided, the fewer theoretical plates are required.

Reflux and Distillation The techniques of recrystallization and the use of the melting points as a criterion of their purity as techniques are used for solids. The technique most commonly used for purifying liquids is distillation. Distillation occurs at the boiling point of the liquid. The boiling point is defined as the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure above the liquid.
