(April 2015). A torque wrench is a tool used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Bahr in 1918 while working for the New York City Water Department.
This is it: the bad wrench. Its scale goes from 20 to 150 ft lbs. It's a half-inch drive Sears Craftsman Microtork 44595, with your standard reversible ratchet. The beauty of the click-type torque wrench is that it's very handy in tight spots and you don't need to be able to see a dial or pointer of any kind.
drive click type torque wrench is the go-to tool when precise torque is needed. The click type design of this torque wrench provides a torque range from 20-150 ft. lbs and is accurate to within +/- 4%.
A torque wrench is used where the tightness of screws and bolts is crucial. It allows the operator to measure the torque applied to the fastener so it can be matched to the specifications for a particular application. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts.
A torque wrench is a tool that allows one to control circular force, or torque, when putting in, removing or tightening a bolt or a nut. It comes in many different styles and levels of complexity depending upon its applications.
Torque is a rotational force applied around a point or, in this case, a nut. Put a 1-foot-long wrench on a nut and apply 10 pounds of force to the opposite end. You're now twisting that nut with 10 ft-lb (distance times force, or 1 foot times 10 pounds).
