Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Although all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galapagos galápagos, penguin lives near the. equator
The Emperor penguins habitat is a harsh one where only a few sturdy and cold-tolerant species manage to survive. The Emperor penguins share their habitat with a few other penguin species, seals, sea birds, lichens, mosses and many different algae species. The Emperor penguins have developed fascinating anatomic features that help them to survive in the unforgiving Emperor penguins habitat. Emperor Penguins Habitat. The Emperor penguins habitat is limited to the Antarctic and the surrounding sea, and unlike many other penguin species the Emperor penguins can rarely be found anywhere else in the world (unless they have been transported by man). The Emperor penguin is a marine bird, and it will only hunt in the ocean

Others live very close to the equator where it is quite warm. All penguins though reside within the Southern hemisphere. They are found on every single island there
The penguin’s habitat also changes depending on what time of year it is. Penguins migrate from the breeding grounds to feeding areas along the coast. Some types of penguins travel very far during their migrations, while others travel only a short way. The penguin also likes to explore, especially while it’s young. The penguin’s habitat can range from a sheet of ice to warm, sandy beaches, depending on what kind of penguin it is. However, one thing that is constant across all types of penguins is the need for a body of water nearby. The penguin cannot fly, so the penguin’s habitat consists of plenty of water for them to swim in
The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Although all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galapagos galápagos, penguin lives near the. equator
