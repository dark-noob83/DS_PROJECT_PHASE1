PGA Tour players get an average carry distance of 136 yards with their pitching wedge. LPGA Tour players get an average carry distance of 100 yards with the same club, according to Andrew Rice Golf.
Increasing Distance. PGA Tour players of the early 21st century unquestionably hit the ball farther than throughout the 20th century. A 2003 Golf Digest article noted that the average PGA Tour drive traveled 260.4 yards in 1993, 279.8 yards in 2002 and 287.8 yards in 2003.
They can hit 5-iron shots 195 to 205 yards; 6-iron shots 180 to 190 yards; 7-iron shots 165 to 180 yards; 8-iron shots 150 to 170 yards; and 9-iron shots 140 to 155 yards. The average distance for a pitching wedge is 130 to 135 yards; for a sand wedge 115 to 120 yards; and for lob wedges 75 to 95 yards.
The following is a list of approximate distances for each club for an average 15+ handicapper, under normal weather conditions. The lower yardage is for female golfers and the higher yardage is for male golfers. Driver - 180-240 yards. 3-wood - 170-210 yards.
An average 3-wood shot carried 238 yards and the average 5-wood carried 223 yards. The typical carry for a 3-iron shot was 203 yards; for a 4-iron 189; for a 5-iron 181; for a 6-iron 169; for a 7-iron 160; for an 8-iron 149; and for a 9-iron 136. The average PGA Tour pitching wedge shot carried 122 yards.
Distance. Men typically hit their pitching wedge from 100 to 140 yards, depending on their skill level, while women hit the same club from 70 to 120 yards. Beginners often find they do not achieve these distances, but their distances will increase as their swing improves.
