Overhaul costs can easily run around $18,000 so an aircraft with a run-out engine will cost quite a bit less than one with a newly rebuilt engine. The good news is most pilots who fly for recreation fly fewer than 100 hours per year. As I recall, 35 to 50 hours per year is more typical.
A small airplane such as a Cessna 172 can cost up to $30 per hour in fuel alone during flight. If you fly 200 hours in a year, it’ll cost $6,000 in fuel alone per year. Whether or not you can justify the cost of a private aircraft depends largely on your sense of financial security and your opinion on quality of life.
If you flew it 10 hours a day it would cost only $100 dollars an hour. Your operating costs go down as your hours of operation go up. On the other hand, PBA owns its fleet of 12 DC-3s outright, all purchased for $20,000 to $120,000 and refurbished for up to $150,000 each.
At the airport where I park my plane it costs $35 per month to park outside or $235 to rent a hangar. The hangar is large enough that in addition to the airplane, I store a car, motorcycle, furniture and boxes of stuff that used to be in our garage.
If you start with a 1970 airplane and try to refurbish it, it will always be a 1970 airplane, no matter what you do. Here's an example. I can buy a 1979 Skylane with a run-out engine at the current wholesale price of about $75,000. A remanufactured engine costs $10,000, paint is $5,000 and the interior is about $3,000.
In this example, the Cessna 310 is 31 years old. So its hourly operating cost is not $112, but $112 plus another 75% — a grand total of $196 per hour! If you can spend only $20,000 on the plane, will you really have nearly $200/hour to operate it? Not likely.
You can get an estimate of aircraft operating costs on AOPA's website or at conklindd.com. For a small single-engine fixed-gear aircraft like a Cessna 172, operating costs can be between $100-$200 per flight hour. Here’s a short list of costs to consider beyond the purchase price of the airplane: 1  Fuel. 2  Oil.
