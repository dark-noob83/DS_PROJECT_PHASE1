Navicular in horses is the most common source of performance-limiting lameness in the front legs of horses. Sadly, the actual cause of navicular lameness is poorly understood, probably because itâ€™s difficult to pinpoint the true cause of the horse hoof or foot pain that your horse experiences.
Some people suspect so but it hasn't been proven. Most likely the reason they suspect so is because on a breeding farm where many of the horses are related, all the horses are often trimmed and/or shod by the same farrier, and what actually causes navicular is improper trimming and shoeing.
The most common cause of locomotor lameness in horses is found in the navicular area of the horse's hoof. The hows and whys of navicular problems are often written-off as un-known.
Overview. An accessory navicular bone is a small bone located in the middle of the foot. It is near the navicular bone, the bone that goes across the foot near the instep. It is a common trait, estimated to be in approximately 2 to 12% of the general population and up to 14% of children. This bone may develop a bump that can cause irritation, swelling, and pain.
Navicular disease can derail a performance horse's career. Arthritis-like changes in the navicular bone, including cysts, channels, chip fragments, and bony spurs, become visible on radiographs, but there is controversy about the connection between such changes and clinical lameness.
The terms Navicular Syndrome (NS) and Navicular Disease (ND) are often used synonymously; however there is a definite difference. There are generally less than 10% of all horses diagnosed with Navicular Syndrome/Disease that actually have radiographic changes or significant degeneration of the Navicular bone (NB).
Because this disease or syndrome can present itself so differently in different horses it is difficult to determine a common cause, but current thinking is that there is excess pressure in the region of the navicular bone in horses with this disease.
