1 Disease can result when normal flora are introduced to an area of the body that is normally axenic, or a location that they do not normally occur in. 2  Bladder infections, typically caused by normal flora E. coli from the colon, are an example of this. However, if the opportunity arises, some of these microbes are able to cause disease and become opportunistic pathogens. This can happen due to a number of different conditions: 1  When the immune system isn’t working properly, normal flora can overpopulate or move into areas of the body where they do not normally occur.
The body’s resident microbiota are just that — residents. These species are life-long members of the body's normal microbial community, but are not found everywhere. There are many areas of the human body that remain axenic, and, in the absence of disease, are never colonized by normal flora. During and after birth, the newborn becomes colonized by microbes, most of which are beneficial to human health. These bacteria are called normal flora or normal microbiota. Article Summary: The human body is made up of about 10 trillion cells, but hosts 100 trillion more.
Sep 13, '09 by choc0late. Resident MO are your own body's defense mechanism, also called normal flora. They are bacteria that live all over your skin and fight off other MO from invading you so to say. Transient are not your own bodies permanent flora. They are temporary per say. Like if you shook my hand some of my normal flora may jump over to your hand for a short time, they would be considered transient flora to you but normal flora to me.
Within the womb, a baby’s body is axenic, meaning that the environment within the uterus is sterile. During and after birth, the newborn becomes colonized by microbes, most of which are beneficial to human health. These bacteria are called normal flora or normal microbiota. Article Summary: The human body is made up of about 10 trillion cells, but hosts 100 trillion more. The vast majority of cells living on and in the body are bacteria and other microbes
Transient bacteria. Some microbiota are considered transient, as they can be only isolated and cultured from skin samples from time to time. These are mainly Gram positive bacteria, including clostridia in the perineal area. Occasionally, moist areas allow the growth of Gram-negative acinetobacter
microbes. Resident microbiota typically colonize the surface of the skin, mucous membranes, digestive tract, upper respiratory system and distal portion of the urogenital system. These microbes do not typically harm the host, while they benefit from feeding on the cellular waste and dead cells of the host's body. During and after birth, the newborn becomes colonized by microbes, most of which are beneficial to human health. These bacteria are called normal flora or normal microbiota. Article Summary: The human body is made up of about 10 trillion cells, but hosts 100 trillion more.
The human body is host to an active ecosystem. We each have microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa in our mouth, eyes, ears, nose, intestines and skin. Although it is popular to believe microbes are dirty, disease-causing creatures, this is a highly biased and narrow view of microbial life. T here are two main types of microbes on our skin: permanent residents and transients. Many people believe washing will remove these bugs and germs.. In fact, studies show even the most vigorous washing does not remove all our special flora.
The skin flora, more properly referred to as the skin microbiota, are the microorganisms which reside on the skin. Most research has been upon those that reside upon the 2 square metres of human skin, cf. the human microbiome. The skin microbiome refer to their genomes. 
Transient skin flora. Transient or temporary skin flora refers to the microorganisms that transiently colonise the skin. This includes bacteria, fungi and viruses, which reach the hands, for example, by direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly via objects. Hygienic hand disinfection primarily aims at deactivating the microorganisms of the transient flora. « Back.
