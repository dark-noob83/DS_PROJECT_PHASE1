Urea, also called carbamide, is an organic chemical compound, and is essentially the waste produced by the body after metabolizing protein. Naturally, the compound is produced when the liver breaks down protein or amino acids, and ammonia; the kidneys then transfer the urea from the blood to the urine.
Urea is actually a part of urine and sweat. As urea is excreted, excess nitrogen in the body goes out with it. Urea is actually solid, colorless and odorless. However, it can give off ammonia in the presence of water. The ammonia gives the strong odor in the urine. The main purpose of urea in the body is to excrete excess nitrogen.
Urea. A by-product of protein metabolism that is formed in the liver. Because urea contains ammonia, which is toxic to the body, it must be quickly filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.
Urea (also known as carbamide) is a waste product of many living organisms, and is the major organic component of human urine.
Urea, chemical formula (NH2)2CO, is one of the waste byproducts created when the body metabolizes proteins for use. Although the body eliminates urea as waste, there are a number of industrial uses for the compound.
Urea is an organic, waste compound produced by the body after metabolizing protein. The liver breaks the proteins down in a process that produces urea. The urea is then excreted by the kidneys in the urine. Urea is also excreted through sweat, and regular healthy skin has a small amount of urea on the very outer layer.
Urea. Urea (also known as carbamide) is a waste product of many living organisms, and is the major organic component of human urine. This is because it is at the end of chain of reactions which break down the amino acids that make up proteins.
