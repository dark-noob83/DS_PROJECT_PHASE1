Record. While the average U.S. adult walks 2.5 to 3 miles per day, the maximum an adult can walk per day is much more than that. An average adult can walk 3 to 4 miles per hour at a comfortable pace or 96 miles in 24 hours. The world record for the most miles walked in 24 hours was set by Paul Forthomme in 1984. Two thousand steps equals roughly a mile of walking. So, the average American walks about 2.5 to 3 miles per day. Assessing the number of steps a person takes during a day is complicated by the inaccuracies of pedometers and accelerometers.
The average person in Canada accumulates approximately 3,500 to 5,000 steps in a day. Research shows that to improve your health you should add 2,000 to 3,000 steps to your routine a day. It only takes five minutes to walk about 500 steps. Add a 30 minute walk to your increased level of activity at work or school and you can see that getting to an active lifestyle at 10,000 steps per day is easier than you may think.
They say that the average person should walk 10000 steps a day. This would be about 5 Miles (8.1 km). However most people would only do 3 or 4. I do 7 or 8 miles a day but im … quite a walker. Id say on average about 4 or 5. The average person takes about 10,000 steps a day, so people walk about 4-5 miles a day, unless you like to walk alot or do sports then your probably around 7 or 8 miles. :) h … ope this helps! + 15 others found this useful.

Report Abuse. Answers I found online ranges from 3000-5000 steps per day. Less active will be around the 3000 range-very active (people who exercise will be around 10,000 or more) 10,000 step is roughly 5 miles. So if you walk to class a lot its easy to guess how far away your class is to your dorm/apartment.

The average person walks between 3,000 and 4,000 steps per day. To find out how many steps you take each day, buy a pedometer similar to the one in the video at the bottom of this page. I walk twice a day-about 4,000 steps each time, I have always done this having had diabetes for 50 years and exercise being part of my regime.. The nurse at my practice (she is very young and very fit) said that what I was doing was pointless because I wasn't walking like those people in the Olympic walking marathons.
U.S. children ages 6 to 11 average approximately 10,400 steps per day for boys and 9,400 for girls. That amounts to roughly 5 miles of walking per day. Boys aged 12 to 17 will take 8,400 and girls 6,400 steps per day, or 3 to 4 miles. Two thousand steps equals roughly a mile of walking. So, the average American walks about 2.5 to 3 miles per day. Assessing the number of steps a person takes during a day is complicated by the inaccuracies of pedometers and accelerometers.
How far is 10,000 steps anyway? The average person's stride length is approximately 2.5 feet long. That means it takes just over 2,000 steps to walk one mile, and 10,000 steps is close to 5 miles. A sedentary person may only average 1,000 to 3,000 steps a day. For these people adding steps has many health benefits. I have outlined the basic 10,000 steps program, but also added a commentary below. 
If you normally walk about 5,000 steps a day, getting in an extra 30-minute, brisk walk into your day would take you to about 8,000 steps, Tudor-Locke said. The average U.S. adult walks about 5,900 steps daily, she said. Experts say that while 10,000 steps a day is a good number to reach, any amount of activity beyond what you're currently doing will likely benefit your health. The origins of the 10,000-steps recommendation aren't exactly scientific.
