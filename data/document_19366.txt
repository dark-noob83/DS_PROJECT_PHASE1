1 In central sensitization, nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord become sensitized by peripheral tissue damage or inflammation. 2  This type of sensitization has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism for chronic pain conditions.
Neural sensitization is the process by which the response of a neuron to a given stimulus is increased. This increase lasts a long time-weeks or months at least. A simple explanation of sensitization is available at the UTHSC web page of Dr. Cynthia Miller http://www.sahs .uth.tmc.edu/brainsurf/aplysia1.html.
The synapse between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron has been strengthened. In the short term, the opening and closing of ion channels in the sensory and motor neurons are altered to produce a greater motor neuron and behavioral response.
Habituation refers to decreases in responses by repeated presentation of a known stimulus; sensitization is the opposite and refers to increased responses, with both types of change resulting from previous experience.
A sensory neuron synapses on a motor neuron. The axon of the sensory neuron is very close to the dendrite of the motor neuron. The axon of the sensory neuron sends a chemical signal called a neurotransmitter
In addition to these molecular targets, neurons that signal central sensitization have also been identified. These neurons are found in lamina I of the spinal cord and they express the substance P (substance P is a neuropeptide released by nociceptive primary afferent neurons) receptor NK-1. Steve Hunt and Pat Mantyh demonstrated this by ablating these neurons with substance P conjugated to saporin (a cellular toxin).
In the previous post on allodynia and hyperalgesia, I mentioned that sensitization of nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were crucial for the development of allodynia and likely contribute strongly to hyperalgesia.
