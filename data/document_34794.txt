Abstract. Amino acids are the building blocks to build peptides and proteins. Recent development in peptide synthesis has however enabled us to mimic this natural process by preparing various long and short peptides possessing different conformations and biological functions. 1. There are some 20 natural amino acids. They are the building blocks for various peptides and proteins. All the amino acids have a similar structure: each consisting of an alpha carbon atom to which a hydrogen atom, an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain R group are attached [1] .
Recently, EAK16-II, an ionic-complementary, self-assembling peptide, has been found to stabilize ellipticine in aqueous solution. Here, the anticancer activity of ellipticine encapsulated in EAK16-II (EAK-EPT) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The design of molecular building units becomes critical in determining the structure, properties, and function of the resulting assemblies. Here, a de novo design principle of amino acid pairing (AAP) to generate new classes of self-assembling peptides (SAPs) is presented.
The term “self-assembly” is a process of molecules or peptides forming regular shaped structures or aggregates in response to conditions in the environment, such as when added to an aqueous medium. The term “self-assembling peptide” refers to a peptide comprising a self-assembling motif. Self-assembling peptides are peptides that are capable of self-assembly into structures including, but not limited to, macroscopic membranes, nanostructures and the like. Patents. The invention relates to a novel class of self-assembling peptides, compositions thereof, methods for the preparation thereof and methods of use thereof. The invention also encompasses methods for tissue regeneration, increasing the production of extracellular matrix proteins, and methods of treatment...
As mentioned in the background section, one advantage that peptides has over carbon as nanosize building blocks is that they have almost limitless chemical functionality compared with the very chemical interactions that carbons can perform due to their nonreactiveness. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of.

The quaternary structure is the combination of two or more different chains of polypeptide to form what is known as a protein sub-unit. The self-assembly process of the peptide chains is dynamic—reassembly occurs repeatedly in a self-healing manner. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of.
The ionic self-complementary peptides have a pattern of alternating positive and negative charged amino acids (e.g. − + − + − + − +, − − + + − − + +, − − − − + + + +), thus forming stable β strand or β sheet structures which can subsequently self-assemble into nanofibers due to the electrostatic interaction. 1. There are some 20 natural amino acids. They are the building blocks for various peptides and proteins. All the amino acids have a similar structure: each consisting of an alpha carbon atom to which a hydrogen atom, an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain R group are attached [1] .
Cancer-targeting peptides can target either tumor cell surfaces or tumor vasculature. The RGD peptide is one of the first tumor-targeting peptides that can bind to self-assembling peptides or any other nanocarrier to improve the therapeutic efficiency of targeting drug delivery systems. The design of molecular building units becomes critical in determining the structure, properties, and function of the resulting assemblies. Here, a de novo design principle of amino acid pairing (AAP) to generate new classes of self-assembling peptides (SAPs) is presented.
These designer peptides have attracted interest in the field of nanotechnology for its potential for application in areas such as biomedical nanotechnology, cell culturing, molecular electronics, and more. Effectively they act as building blocks for a wide range of material and device applications. The essence of this technology is to replicate what nature does: to use molecular recognition processes to form ordered assemblies of building blocks that are capable of conducting biochemical activities. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of.
