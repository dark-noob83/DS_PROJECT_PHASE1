High: ages 0 to 9: 100 mg/dL or higher, ages 10 to 19: 130 mg/dL or higher. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults have their cholesterol checked every four to six years, starting at age 20, which is when cholesterol levels can start to go up. As we age, cholesterol levels tend to rise. Men are generally at a higher risk than women
Age is a major factor in the amount of cholesterol in your blood. Being older than 45 years old if you're a man and older than 55 if you're a woman is a risk factor for having a cholesterol problem, according to the U.S. government's National Cholesterol Education Program, or NCEP. Men's average total cholesterol is 205 mg/dL when they're 40 to 49 and 208 mg/dL when they're 50 and above. Below age 40, men's average total cholesterol is 185 mg/dL but for women it is 183 mg/dL.
Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels. Blood cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A deciliter is one-tenth of a liter). NCEP defines a desirable total cholesterol level as less than 200 mg/dL, and levels for most women stay in the healthy or desirable range until middle-age. But between the ages of 45 and 55, women's average total cholesterol rises to almost 220 mg/dL. Between the ages of 55 and 64, those levels average 240 mg/dL. A desirable total cholesterol level for adults without heart disease is less than 200 mg/dL. An HDL cholesterol level of 60 mg/dL and above is considered protective against heart disease, while a level less than 50 mg/dL for women or 40 mg/dL for men is considered a major risk factor for heart disease.
In the United States, cholesterol levels are calculated in milligrams of cholesterol for each deciliter of blood. A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. In that case, your doctor might advise you to develop a preventing low cholesterol diet plan. More than 240 mg per dL (6.3 mmol/L) is the high-risk class. A score below 40 mg per dL (1 mmol/L) for men, and 50 mg per dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women is known to be low. This places you at threat of cardiovascular problems. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men.
Adults. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults have their cholesterol checked every four to six years, starting at age 20, which is when cholesterol levels can start to go up. As we age, cholesterol levels tend to rise. Men are generally at a higher risk than women
The average, or normal, good cholesterol in men is 42 to 44 mg/dL at all ages; while the average good cholesterol in women is 53 mg/dL before age 30, 57 mg/dL at ages 30 to 39, 58 mg/dL at ages 40 to 49, 60 mg/dL at ages 50 to 59 and 62 mg/dL above 60. Men's average total cholesterol is 205 mg/dL when they're 40 to 49 and 208 mg/dL when they're 50 and above. Below age 40, men's average total cholesterol is 185 mg/dL but for women it is 183 mg/dL.
LDL levels are therefore the very best gauge of risk of cardiac arrest. A low LDL cholesterol is much better. Lower than 100 mg per dL (2.6 mmol/L) is the ideal. Between 100 and 129 mg per dL (2.6 and 3.3 mmol/L) is close to ideal, while between 130 and 159 mg per dL (3.4 and 4.1 mmol/L) is borderline elevated. A score below 40 mg per dL (1 mmol/L) for men, and 50 mg per dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women is known to be low. This places you at threat of cardiovascular problems. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men.
Total blood (or serum) cholesterol. Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. HDL (good) cholesterol. With HDL cholesterol, higher levels are better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. But first, you have to know your cholesterol numbers. The American Heart Association recommends all adults age 20 or older have their cholesterol, and other traditional risk factors, checked every four to six years. Your test report will show your cholesterol levels in milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL).
Total cholesterol above 200 mg/dL is a risk factor, the NCEP reports. Men's average total cholesterol is 205 mg/dL when they're 40 to 49 and 208 mg/dL when they're 50 and above. Below age 40, men's average total cholesterol is 185 mg/dL but for women it is 183 mg/dL.
