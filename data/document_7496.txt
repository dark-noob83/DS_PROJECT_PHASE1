Bake chicken legs and thighs for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Wings will take about 25 to 30 minutes. Chicken legs, thighs, and wings cook faster than the larger bone-in breasts. Chicken thigh and leg quarters will take longer if cooked as one piece--about 1 hour. Check doneness with a meat thermometer.
