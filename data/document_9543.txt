If you can personally report your injury, do so. If you are unable to report your injury because of your medical condition, have a family member, friend or health care provider notify your employer of the injury as soon as possible.
The law requires an employee to report a single event injury within 30 days or for medical treatment to be obtained within the 30-day period. In cases of occupational disease or injuries caused by repeated trauma, an employee must give notice to the employer within 90 days of the employeeâ€™s separation from employment.
But for injuries that happen over time, you need to report your injury to the employer within 30 days of the date you suffer a temporary disability (that is, when you lose time from work or seek medical treatment) and you realize (or should have realized) that the injury was due to work.
In addition to reporting the injury to your employer, you will also need to file a claim with the Colorado Division of Workers' Compensation (DOWC) within, in most instances, 2 years of your injury.
