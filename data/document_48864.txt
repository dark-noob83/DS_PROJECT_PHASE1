As a rough idea you can typically say that it will cost at least £1000 per m 2 or 93 per ft 2 including basic plumbing and electrician work. This price is per unit area of internal floor space and so a 5x4m single floor extension will have a total floor area of 20m 2 and a double storey will have 40m 2. Typically, a single storey extension will cost more per metre squared than a double storey. In theory a triple storey would cost less still. In practise the difference in cost may be small though. The price per square metre also depends on the size of the property.
