Fire needs three elements to exist – fuel, oxygen and heat. To understand the relationships, think of each as separate sides of a triangle. Fire needs all three elements in the proper proportions to exist. If one side of the triangle is removed, the fire will go out.
A fire triangle is used as a model for conveying the components of a fire. The fire triangle’s three sides illustrate the three elements of fire, which are heat, fuel, and oxidization. The three elements must be combined in the right proportions for a fire to occur. If any of the three elements are removed, the fire is extinguished. The first element in the fire triangle is heat, which is perhaps the most essential of fire elements. A fire cannot ignite unless it has a certain amount of heat, and it cannot grow without heat either.
The fire triangle or combustion triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires. The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent (usually oxygen). A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture, meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing.
The second element in the fire triangle is fuel. A fire needs a fuel source in order to burn. The fuel source can be anything that is flammable, such as wood, paper, fabric, or chemicals. Once the fuel element of the fire triangle is removed, the fire will go out.
