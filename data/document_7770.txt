Warts and Plantar Warts-Symptoms. Warts occur in a variety of shapes and sizes. A wart may appear as a bump with a rough surface, or it may be flat and smooth. Tiny blood vessels (capillaries) grow into the core of the wart to supply it with blood. In both common and plantar warts, these capillaries may appear as dark dots (seeds) in the wart's center. 1  Common warts usually appear singly or in groups on the hands, although they may grow on any part of the body.
On average plantar warts and palmer warts are small, about the size of a pencil eraser. But some warts grow bigger. Sometimes plantar warts can grow in clusters; those are called mosaic warts. Sometimes corns or calluses are mistaken for a palmer or plantar wart. In some warts, little black dots appear, leading people to call them seed warts. Actually the black dots are little blood vessels that have grown up into the wart.
What are the symptoms and how are plantar warts diagnosed? These warts can look like small, fleshy bumps; hard, flat growths with a rough surface and well-defined boundaries; or gray or brown lumps with tiny pinprick-size black dots (clotted blood vessels that distinguish warts from bloodless corns and calluses).

Palmer warts occur on the hands, and plantar warts on the bottom of the foot. Virtually everyone will have a wart (or several) someplace at some time in their lives.
