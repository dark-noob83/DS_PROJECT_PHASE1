Credit Scores. Auto lenders and lessors examine your credit scores when determining the interest rate on your loan or lease. Your credit score ranges from 300 to 850. Having a higher credit score qualifies you for a lower interest rate -- which translates to a lower monthly payment. Typically, a score of 700 or higher indicates to the lender that you deserve their best rates. If your score is above 680, but below 700, your rate may rise a little, around 1 to 2 percent higher than the best rate
