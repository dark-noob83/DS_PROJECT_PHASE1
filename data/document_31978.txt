Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. is an ascomycete fungus known in China since antiquity, which is still being used today. A summary, showing relevant papers about this fungus, regarding habitat, history, marketing, consumption, nomenclature, pharmacological composition, culture and medical use, is presented.
Introduction. Fungi make an extraordinarily important contribution to managing disease in humans and other animals. At the beginning of the 21st century, Fungi were involved in the industrial processing of more than 10 of the 20 most profitable products used in human medicine. Two anti-cholesterol statins, the antibiotic penicillin and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A are among the top 10.
1 Medicine-Some fungi are used to killed bacteria that can cause infections and disease in humans. 2  They make antibiotics like penicillin and cephalosporin. 3  Mushrooms-Mushrooms are part of the club fungi group. 4  Mushrooms are the fruiting body of a fungus.
Fungi is used in medicine such as medicine that helps your bones.
In 1941, penicillin from the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum was first used successfully to treat an infection caused by a bacterium. Use of penicilin revolutionised the treatment of pathogenic disease. Many formally fatal diseases caused by bacteria became treatable, and new forms of medical intervention were possible.
Many fungi play a crucial role in decomposition (breaking things down) and returning nutrients to the soil. They are also used in medicine, an example is the antibiotic penicillin, as well as in industry and food preparation. For a long time fungi were classified as plants, mainly because of their similar lifestyles-both are seen to grow in soil and are sessile (permanently attached; not moving).
The type of fungi which are used in medicine are known as Penicillium chrysogenum. These are used in the manufacture of penicillin which is an antibiotic.
