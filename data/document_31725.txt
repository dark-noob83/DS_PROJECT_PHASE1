If you are using protein supplements, be sure to choose a product that has been third-party evaluated for its quality. Background. Whey is a type of protein found in milk that contains all the essential amino acids (EAA) are needed for muscle growth and repair. Dairy products such as milk and some cheeses are the best “whole food” sources of whey protein.
Food Sources. Protein foods are broken down into parts called amino acids during digestion. The human body needs a number of amino acids in large enough amounts to maintain good health. Amino acids are found in animal sources such as meats, milk, fish, and eggs. They are also found in plant sources such as soy, beans, legumes, nut butters, and some grains (such as wheat germ and quinoa). You do not need to eat animal products to get all the protein you need in your diet.
Whole foods, not dietary supplements, should be your first choice for protein. Protein supports muscle growth and repair. People often turn to protein supplements (such as whey, casein, and soy) to optimize those effects, especially after a workout. Whole food protein sources such as lean meats, fish, dairy products, legumes, nuts, and seeds are just as effective (in some cases more effective) than protein supplements.
Supplements can be in the form of ready-to-drink shakes, bars, bites, oats, and gels and powders, and come in a variety of flavors. What follows is a review of the scientific literature on the good, the bad ,and the ugly regarding protein supplements.
