Lanugo is also common on other animals. For example, seals and elephants are often born with a covering of lanugo. Fetal whales, like humans and all other primates, also have lanugo. It is replaced by hair covering the same surfaces called vellus hair, but this hair is finer and more difficult to see. The more visible hair that continues into adulthood is called terminal hair. This forms in specific areas and is hormone dependent.
The fetal period of prenatal development begins on the last day of the eighth week after fertilization and continues until birth. This stage is characterized by the exponential growth of the embryo, now called a fetus, and the development of fully differentiated organs and tissues. Between weeks 13 and 16, the baby begins to move with regularity. Lanugo, a fine, downy hair, begins to grow on the head. Meconium, a thick, dark green waste substance, is produced in the fetus' bowels and remains there (in most cases) until after birth.
The expert answers: Lanugo is the name given to the soft, fine, downy hair that covers a newborn. It is more frequently seen in premature infants as it begins to be shed in-utero during the final month of pregnancy. Some post-term infants are born with minimal lanugo. The amount of lanugo is variable and some parents are concerned by the amount of hair covering their new infant. The hair can cover all skin except for the lips, palms of the hands and soles of the feet, sides of the fingers and toes, nails, glans of the penis and insides of the labia minora and majora
Vernix caseosa, also known as vernix, is the waxy or cheese-like white substance found coating the skin of newborn human babies. Vernix starts developing on the baby in the womb around 18 weeks into pregnancy. Vernix corneocytes lack desmosomal attachment and this distinguishes them from corneocytes found in mature stratum corneum. Thickness of a corneocyte is 1-2 µm. These cells are surrounded by a layer of amorphous lipids lacking typical lamellar architecture present
1 Anorexia is a general loss of appetite, or a loss of interest in food. 2  Anorexia nervosa is a serious mental illness. 3  Patients have not lost interest in food, they have intentionally restricted their food intake because of an irrational fear of being or becoming fat. A patient with anorexia nervosa, often just called anorexia (although the meaning is different), has a distorted body image and an exaggerated fear of becoming overweight or obese-so a deliberate effort is made to lose weight.

Lanugo (/ləˈnuːɡoʊ, -ˈnjuː-/ ; from Latin lana wool) is very fine, soft, and usually unpigmented, downy hair as can be found on the body of a fetus or newborn baby. It is the first hair to be produced by the fetal hair follicles, and it usually appears on the fetus at about five months of gestation. It is replaced by hair covering the same surfaces called vellus hair, but this hair is finer and more difficult to see. The more visible hair that continues into adulthood is called terminal hair. This forms in specific areas and is hormone dependent.
Vernix has a highly variable makeup but is primarily composed of sebum, cells that have sloughed off the fetus's skin and shed lanugo hair. 12% of the dry weight of vernix is branched-chain fatty acid-containing lipids, cholesterol and ceramide. Vernix corneocytes lack desmosomal attachment and this distinguishes them from corneocytes found in mature stratum corneum. Thickness of a corneocyte is 1-2 µm. These cells are surrounded by a layer of amorphous lipids lacking typical lamellar architecture present
During human development, the lanugo grows on fetuses as a normal part of gestation, but is usually shed and replaced by vellus hair at about 33 to 36 weeks of gestational age. It is replaced by hair covering the same surfaces called vellus hair, but this hair is finer and more difficult to see. The more visible hair that continues into adulthood is called terminal hair. This forms in specific areas and is hormone dependent.
