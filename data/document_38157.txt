A stool test is one of many tests used to look for colorectal cancer. These tests may find cancer early, when treatment works better. Colorectal cancer affects the large intestine (colon) and the rectum. There are three kinds of stool tests: 1  Fecal occult blood test (FOBT).
Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). Put simply, the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, tests the stool for blood to determine if a more comprehensive examination is necessary. Occult, or hidden, blood is a critical symptom in the detection of precancerous polyps or colon cancer.
FIT (Fecal Immunochemical Test) is a stool test used to look for possible signs of colorectal cancer. This test is able to look for a specific type of blood in your stool which helps identify if you have any polyps (pre-cancerous growths) in your colon.
A fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a type of fecal occult blood test that screens for colon cancer by using antibodies to detect the presence of human hemoglobin, or blood, in the stool. This blood in the stool cannot be seen by the naked eye and is therefore called occult blood.
A American Cancer Society answered. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT), also called an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT), is a newer kind of test that also detects occult (hidden) blood in the stool. This test reacts to part of the human hemoglobin protein, which is found on red blood cells.
The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a newer screening test for colon cancer. It tests for hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of cancer. FIT only detects human blood from the lower intestines.
The main use for the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is as a screen for early colon cancer. Most cases of colon cancer begin with the development of benign intestinal polyps. Benign polyps are relatively common in people over the age of 50.
