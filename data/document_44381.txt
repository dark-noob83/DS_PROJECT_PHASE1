1 Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). 2  Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. 3  High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with a increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. 1 Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. 2  High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with a increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. 3  Extremely high triglyceride level s (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
A simple blood test can reveal whether your triglycerides fall into a healthy range. 1  Normal — Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or less than 1.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). 2  Borderline high — 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.2 mmol/L). 
1 Highly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty liver disease and pancreatitis. 2  High triglyceride levels can also be associated with diabetes, kidney disease, and the use of some medications. 3  Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150 mg per deciliter (mg/dL). How to Lower Triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. High levels of triglycerides may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women. A person's triglyceride levels are measured with a blood test along with testing cholesterol levels
1 Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150 mg per deciliter (mg/dL). 2  Triglyceride levels can be controlled to some extent by lifestyle modifications and, when necessary, medications. How to Lower Triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. High levels of triglycerides may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women. A person's triglyceride levels are measured with a blood test along with testing cholesterol levels
The National Cholesterol Education Program sets guidelines for triglyceride levels: Normal triglycerides means there are less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline high triglycerides = 150 to 199 mg/dL. High triglycerides = 200 to 499 mg/dL. Very high triglycerides = 500 mg/dL or higher. High triglyceride levels may lead to heart disease, especially in people with low levels of good cholesterol and high levels of bad cholesterol, and in people with type 2 diabetes. Experts disagree, though, on just how bad of an effect high triglyceride levels by themselves have on the heart.
Triglyceride Ranges. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL
Test Results. If your blood triglyceride levels are normal, your test results will be less than 150 milligrams per deciliter. The range for borderline high triglycerides is 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter. The range for high is 200 to 499 milligrams per deciliter. Any level above 499 is considered very high.
Triglycerides are one of the types of fat in the body and your level can be measured with a blood test. The test is more accurate if it is done after fasting from food and drinks for 9 to 12 hours. The normal range for triglyceride level for adults is less than 150 mg/dL. A triglyceride level less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal for adults, according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. A triglyceride level of 150 to 200 mg/dL is borderline high. A triglyceride result of 200 to 499 mg/dL is high, and levels of 500 mg/dL or more are very high
