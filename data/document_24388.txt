Lower Salaries Than the NFL. The average player salary in the CFL isn't made public. A 2014 article in The MMQB, a Sports Illustrated-run football website, estimated the average salary in the league at $80,000. The average NFL player made $1.9 million in 2012.
Add in pre-season salary and bonuses and the website suggests the average salary for CFL players, not including quarterbacks, could be around $80,000 CAD per year. Monster.com, an online job search and salary database, estimates that amount to be closer to $50,000 CAD.
In general, basketball players earn millions of dollars. The  better players like Lebron James and Dwyane Wade will earn around  $25 million a year, average players like Bra … d Miller will earn  around $10 million a year, and rookies will earn from $800,000 a  year to $2 million a year.
Many people say not alot, but it's not true. Many CFL players you know get paid between $150,000 - $300,000 top players like QB's get paid $500,000. Remember bonuses, and CFL pension which is actually quite good.
Average Salaries. The average salary of an NFL player works out to considerably less when not considering the top earners, but these players still make hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Bloomberg Businessweek says the average salary of an NFL player in 2011 was $1.9 million. The median salary was $770,000.
Salaries in the Canadian Football League are much lower than those  in the National Football League. CFL players make an average salary  of $80,000 per year.
Answering my own questions since 2001. Minimum salaries in the CFL this year are $30,000 for rookies and $32,000 for veterans. The minimum increases to $35,000 next year as a result of the CFL’s new Collective Bargaining Agreement. The average CFL salary is about $45,000 Canadian.
The CFL doesn’t disclose salary information so it’s hard to say exactly how much players make. But according to one report from the independent CFL database called CFLDB.ca, the Collective Bargaining Agreement set the minimum base salary for CFL players at $43,000 in 2011 with an increase of $1000 per year until 2013.
