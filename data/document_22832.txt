1 For example, the average assisted senior home in Alabama costs $2,800 while a home in California can cost more than $6,000 on average. 2  According to the American Association of Homes and Services, the average daily cost for a private room in a nursing home was $213 per day. 1 The average daily cost of a semi-private room was $189. 2  According to the site AssistedSeniorLiving.net, the price to get the service can range anywhere from $70 to $300 per day while monthly rates can range from $1,800 for a lower end home, while higher end senior assisted living can cost $9,000.
HOW MUCH DOES ASSISTED LIVING COST. The national average for a private one bedroom apartment in an assisted living community is a little over $3,000 ($36,000 annually). These prices parallel the cost of living in a certain area.
@Marlene--first read the article. The ave. price of assisted living is around $3000, not $6000. Even for the $6000 in a SKILLED Nursing, you seem to be ignoring the cost of meds, keeping nurses and other caregivers on staff 24-hr/day, and the high acuity of some of the residents. 
The Cost Of Assisted Living. The average cost for living in an Assisted Living facility ranges between $60 and $80 per day ($1800 to $2400/month) for the basics. This cost covers room and board, basic utilities (electricity, heat, water, and garbage), basic housekeeping (fresh linens) and some meals. This is similar to what many seniors would pay in an Independent Living facility but is much less expensive than the $70-$300 per day ($2100 to $9000/month) for a Nursing Home.. Use the Senior Service by state (right toolbar) to get more detailed information about the cost of senior living in that state.
1 The facilities that the senior assisted living offers can affect the price, and this is the reason why the cost can range anywhere from $70 to $350 per day, while monthly rates can range from $2,100 to $10,000. 2  Amenities, geographical locations, and more can greatly influence the overall price tag. 1 The average daily cost of a semi-private room was $189. 2  According to the site AssistedSeniorLiving.net, the price to get the service can range anywhere from $70 to $300 per day while monthly rates can range from $1,800 for a lower end home, while higher end senior assisted living can cost $9,000.

The average cost for a private one-bedroom apartment in an assisted living residence is over $3,000 per month, according to research compiled by several nonprofit senior living organizations, including the Assisted Living Federation of America. Assisted living is of often less expensive than home health or nursing home care in the same geographic area. More than half of assisted living communities use a tiered pricing model with bundled services, according to research. For instance, a resident needing very little assistance would be at the lowest tier.
Again, costs vary by state, but the average monthly cost for an assisted living center in most states is between $1000 and $3000 per month. Monthly costs in Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, Washington D.C. and Wyoming are higher than average, sometimes up to $5000 per month. As you can see, on average, the cost of an assisted living center is about half that of a nursing home facility. For this reason, unless the patient requires a high level of care on a daily basis, an assisted living center will usually be preferable.
Just as the cost of real estate varies by geographic area, assisted living costs also vary nationwide. In the 2015 Cost of Care Survey conducted by Genworth Financial, assisted living showed an increase of 2.86% compared to the 2014 costs and the national median monthly rate is $3,600.
