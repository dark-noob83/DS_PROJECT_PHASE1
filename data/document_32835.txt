germ layer (germ cell layer) any of the three primary layers of cells formed in the early development of the embryo (ectoderm, entoderm, and mesoderm), from which the organs and tissues develop.
A germ layer is a primary layer of cells that form during embryogenesis. The three germ layers in vertebrates are particularly pronounced; however, all eumetazoans, (animals more complex than the sponge) produce two or three primary germ layers. Animals with radial symmetry, like cnidarians, produce two germ layers (the ectoderm and endoderm) making them diploblastic.
germ layer. germ layer. endoderm and adjacent germ layers. n. Any of the three primary cellular layers, the ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm, into which most animal embryos differentiate and from which the organs and tissues of the body develop.
Germ layer is any of three cellular layers formed during animal embryogenesis that give rise through further differentiation to the various structures (organs, tissues) of the organism.
germ layer. endoderm and adjacent germ layers. n. Any of the three primary cellular layers, the ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm, into which most animal embryos differentiate and from which the organs and tissues of the body develop.
Germ layer is a collection of cells found in a prenatal embryo that will give rise to all of the bodyâ€™s tissues and organs. Germ layer, occasionally referred to as germinal epithelium (one of the 4 basic type of animal tissue), is a group of cells, formed during animal embryogenesis.
