Best Answer: The most common is Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium The more severe relative that causes typhoid fever is Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi For both enterica is the species name. Source(s): Microbiologist. Weise Ente · 6 years ago. EDIT: Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod shaped, flagellated, aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, and a member of the genus Salmonella.
Initially, each Salmonella species was named according to clinical considerations, for example Salmonella typhi-murium (mouse typhoid fever), S. cholerae-suis. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by S Typhimurium or S Enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later.
Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod-shaped, flagellated, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the genus Salmonella. A number of its serovars are serious human pathogens. Main article: Salmonellosis. Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with S. enterica, which often infects cattle and poultry, though also other animals such as domestic cats and hamsters have also been shown to be sources of infection to humans.
Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can be found in raw meats, poultry, and some other types of produce. This bacteria can cause a lot of different types of illness from an … upset stomach to food poisoning and may be fatal. A type of Salmonella can also cause typhoid fever. 
Salmonella /ˌsaelməˈnɛlə/ ˌsælməˈnɛlə is a genus of-rod (shaped) bacillus bacteria of The enterobacteriaceae. Family there are two species Of, Salmonella salmonella bongori And salmonella. enterica Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by S Typhimurium or S Enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later.
Definition. Salmonella infection is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food. Typically, people with salmonella infection have no symptoms.
Best Answer: Actually, Salmonella is a scientific name for a genus of bacteria. There are many species like Salmonella minnesota, Salmonella enteritidis etc. Salmonella is a genus (that is, a group of very closely-related) of bacteria. So Salmonella is the scientific name for any one of a number of bacteria. There are 3 species within the Salmonella genus: Salmonella bongori Salmonella enterica Salmonella typhi Salmonella enterica is the one that causes food poisoning. Salmonella typhi is the one that causes Typhoid fever. Brian L · 7 years ago
Salmonella enterica has 6 subspecies, and each subspecies has associated serovars that differ by antigenic specificity. There are over 2500 serovars for S. enterica. Salmonella bongori used to be considered a subspecies of S. enterica, but it is now the other species in the Salmonella genus. Main article: Salmonellosis. Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with S. enterica, which often infects cattle and poultry, though also other animals such as domestic cats and hamsters have also been shown to be sources of infection to humans.
There are two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica is further divided into six subspecies and over 2500 serovars. Salmonellae are found worldwide in both cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, and in the environment. Most cases of invasive nontyphoidal salmonella infection (iNTS) are caused by S Typhimurium or S Enteritidis. A new form of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST313) emerged in the southeast of the African continent 75 years ago, followed by a second wave which came out of central Africa 18 years later.
