Snapshot (Just the Facts): The 2014 mean combined GMAT score is a 547.35. Keep in mind that this mean score is quite low, and that the top 10 business schools, like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale, have an average GMAT score of 720 â€“ which is in the 94th percentile. We can also break the mean scores down by section:
The average GMAT score of accepted students at Harvard Business School is 707. In the early nineties, the average GMAT score of accepted students at New York University (Stern) Business School was 610. As of last year, NYU's average GMAT test score for accepted applicants had jumped 90 points to approximately 700.
In recent years, the average GMAT score worldwide is 570. There is no acceptable or minimum score. What score you should obtain depends on which school you are going to apply to. Generally, the higher the school ranks, the higher score you must obtain. For the top 50 programs, the averaged GMAT score is 660. Below is a table of median GMAT scores for some top MBA programs.
More important is the average GMAT score of accepted students at your school of choice. If you're headed to Harvard or Stanford, the average score is suddenly 710 or 720. Plenty of schools have average scores in the high 600s. And many, many programs have average scores down in the 400s and 500s.
Remember, those are average GMAT scores, which means that individual scores at each of those schools vary both above and below those numbers. If your GMAT score is, say, 740, then it would be above-average for every business school in the world.
GMAT scores at the top business schools keep inching higher. The average score on the Graduate Management Admission Test rose at 10 of the Top 25 MBA programs in the U.S. last year and some of the largest increases were at public universities.
