A balance transfer is when you pay off the balances on existing cards or loans by transferring them to another credit card account. (In some cases, you may be charged a fee to complete the balance transfer—typically a percentage of the transfer balance. More about that later.).
It's not just balances from other credit cards that can be transferred. You may be able to move loans for cars, appliances, furniture and other monthly installment payments to a no-interest balance transfer credit card, using checks from the bank that issues the credit card. 4. Fees are inevitable.
You can transfer balances such as store credit cards, gas cards and other credit cards. Just remember, when you are approved for a credit card you will be given a certain credit limit and you can only transfer up to that amount—be sure to account for any balance transfer fees (typically 3% to 5%).

You can only transfer an amount up to your credit limit on the new card. So if your credit limit is $5,000 on the new card and you want to transfer a balance of $6,000, you will only be able to transfer up to $5,000 (including any balance transfer fee) of that existing balance.
