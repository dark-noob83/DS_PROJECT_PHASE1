Steel is a metal alloy consisting mostly of iron, in addition to small amounts of carbon, depending on the grade and quality of the steel. Alloy steel is any type of steel to which one or more elements besides carbon have been intentionally added, to produce a desired physical property or characteristic.
Each alloy is distinct from its components, and the properties of each alloy are distinct. Indeed, the purpose in forming an alloy is to provide a metallic substance with physical, mechanical and/or chemical properties and characteristics that are different from those of its components.
Steels that contain specified amounts of alloying elements — other than carbon and the commonly accepted amounts of manganese, copper, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus — are known as alloy steels. Alloying elements are added to change mechanical or physical properties.
Carbon steels are steels in which the main alloying additive is carbon. Alloy steels are alloyed with other metals or materials, in addition to carbon, to improve properties.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with a variety of elements in total amounts between 1.0% and 50% by weight to improve its mechanical properties. Alloy steels are broken down into two groups: low-alloy steels and high-alloy steels.
Carbon & Alloy Steel. Carbon steel is an alloy consisting of iron and carbon. Several other elements are allowed in carbon steel, with low maximum percentages. These elements are manganese, with a 1.65% maximum, silicon, with a 0.60% maximum, and copper, with a 0.60% maximum.
The following is a range of improved properties in alloy steels (as compared to carbon steels): strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, hardenability, and hot hardness. To achieve some of these improved properties the metal may require heat treating.
