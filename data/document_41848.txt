Motor Vehicle Records. A motor vehicle record (MVR) is the printout of a driving or vehicle record. The manner in which driver license or MVR information may be released is regulated by the Federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (or DPPA), 18 USC 2721-2725 as adopted in Arizona law, Title 28, Chapter 2, Article 5.
If you’ve just applied for a job involving driving responsibilities, then it is likely that your potential employer will run a motor vehicle record check as part of your pre-employment background screening.
It is because of this that a motor vehicle record check is a mainstay in the employment check process for any potential drivers, and why it could have an important influence on whether you get the job.
Motor vehicle reports, also referred to as an MVR or a driving record, help car insurance companies determine how to set rates. They show information about your driver license, traffic violations, and sometimes even personal information about you.
