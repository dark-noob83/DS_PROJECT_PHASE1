The supposed difference between Rule Utilitarianism and Act Utilitarianism. For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone.
The differences between rule and act utilitarianism are as follows: the act utilitarian only considers the results or consequences of a single action whereas the rule utilitarian considers the consequences that result of following a rule of conduct. Let's take a simple example to make this clearer.
Therefore the difference between act and rule utilitarianism, is that rule utilitarianism is based on rules and following the rules, even if it does not produce the greatest pleasure for the greatest number, as telling the truth instead of lying is good for everyone.
1. Act utilitarianism is the belief that an action becomes morally right when it produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people, while Rule utilitarianism is the belief that the moral correctness of an action depends on the correctness of the rules that allows it to achieve the greatest good. 2.
ACT and RULE Utilitarianism. There is a difference between rule and act utilitarianism. The act utilitarian considers only the results or consequences of the single act while the rule utilitarian considers the consequences that result of following a rule of conduct.
Conversely, the other type of utilitarianism is based on rules. These rules can include rules of conduct and similar principles. It is a more idealistic and rigid theory wherein an act is interpreted to be either right or wrong depending on the result of the agreed rule.
