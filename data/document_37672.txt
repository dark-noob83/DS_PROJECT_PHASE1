1. Origin and Insertion. i. Contractions of skeletal muscles produce movements by exerting a pulling force on tendons, which in turn pull on bones (or other structures, such as skin). ii. Most muscles extend across at least one joint and are attached to the articulating bones that form the joint. iii.
The human body is a complex network of symbiotic systems. The skeletal system and the muscular system work together as the framework for the body as well as providing the pieces that allow for movement. The bones provide a solid frame to support the body as well as protection for internal organs. The bones come together at joints which allow for movement of individual limbs as well as movement of the entire body in conjunction with skeletal tissue and the muscular system.
Muscular system is the system of Human Body that provides motor power for all movements of body parts. Muscular system is composed of special tissue called muscular tissue. Muscles have the ability to contract actvely to provide the force for movements of body parts. Muscular system has the following important functions in human body; 1  MOVEMENTS OF BODY PARTS: Skeletal muscles are responsible for all voluntary movements of human body parts. 2  They provide the force by contracting actively at the expense of energy
Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs. 
(Also Called 'Normal Structure and Function of the Musculoskeletal System-Anatomy'). A basic primer on bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and cartilages. The skeletal system includes the bones of the skeleton and the cartilages, ligaments, and other connective tissue that stabilize or connect the bones. 1 Skeletal muscles â€” These muscles contract to pull on tendons and move the bones of the skeleton. 2  In addition to producing skeletal movement, muscles also maintain posture and body position, support soft tissues, guard entrances and exits to the digestive and urinary tracts, and maintain body temperature.
Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism. The arms and legs are part of the appendicular skeleton. The upper bones of the limbs are single: humerus (arm) and femur (leg). Below a joint (elbow or knee), both limbs have a pair of bones (radius and ulna in the arms; tibia and fibula in legs) that connect to another joint (wrist or ankle).
1 MOVEMENTS OF BODY PARTS: Skeletal muscles are responsible for all voluntary movements of human body parts. 2  They provide the force by contracting actively at the expense of energy. 3  In other words, muscles are motors of body where chemical energy of food is converted into mechanical work.

3. Identify the various arrangements of muscle fibers in a skeletal muscle, and relate the arrangements to the strength of contraction and range of motion. 4. Explain how the prime mover, antagonist, synergist, and fixator in a muscle group work together to produce movements. 5. Origin and Insertion. i. Contractions of skeletal muscles produce movements by exerting a pulling force on tendons, which in turn pull on bones (or other structures, such as skin). ii.
